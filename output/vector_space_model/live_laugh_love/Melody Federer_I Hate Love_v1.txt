[Verse 1]
Broken toys falling for each other
On an island
There was no other person who saw me for who I was
Or made me feel beautiful
Driving through the rainy streets of Seattle
Pop songs play and my brain gets rattled
With vignettes of you tangled up with me
Strangers, lovers, now we're enemies

[Chorus]
Oh, I hate love
I need you, I want you
Now don’t show up
Don’t call me, I’ll block you
Take time alone, I’ll try my best to fix myself
Oh, I hate love
I need you, I want you
It’s so fucked up
Can’t live without touching you
Please don’t call, I need time to fix myself
But I can’t seem to fix myself

[Verse 2]
Call me evil, it’s like you’re bipolar
Do it again, I’ll get a restraining order
Take your shit back to your apartment
I’ll act like I’m not brokenhearted
Oh, the good times felt so damn good
New Year’s Eve
I really thought I could see forever in your eyes
Pretty promises turned to ugly lies

[Chorus]
Oh, I hate love
I need you, I want you
Now don’t show up
Don’t call me, I’ll block you
Take time alone, I’ll try my best to fix myself
Oh, I hate love
I need you, I want you
It’s so fucked up
Can’t live without touching you
Please don’t call, I need time to fix myself
But I can’t seem to fix myself
