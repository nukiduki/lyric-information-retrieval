[Verse 1]
Play us like pawns
And relentlessly confined
Into living up to gender roles
And having absent minds
Don't you think it's funny how they tell us how to live
Don't you think it's funny how we're all delinquent kids
Like hush, now
Don't say, don't say

[Chorus]
Hush boy, oh hush boy
Don't say a word
Throw on a jersey
No one gets hurt
Hush girl, oh hush girl
Just bat your eyes
Play our little game
Play our little game

[Verse 2]
Bounded all thoughts
And corrected common sense
You're raising suicidals
With your predetermined titles
Like a mess, distressed
I am unimpressed
Your excess, a dress
Is all you'll ever be
Gender roles impose control
And deceive progressive times
Welcome, to the land of the broken mind

[Chorus]
Hush boy, oh hush boy
Don't say a word
Throw on a jersey
No one gets hurt
Hush girl, oh hush girl
Just bat your eyes
Play our little game
Play our little game
Hush boy, oh hush boy
Don't say a word
Throw on a jersey
No one gets hurt
Hush girl, oh hush girl
Just bat your eyes
Play our little game
Play our little game

[Bridge]
We feign opulence
Just to get by
Put on false confidence
Just to feel alive
They can't hurt me anymore
There's nothing left to break of me
There's nothing left to take from me
'Cause baby, it's easy to fake a smile
When you've been doing it for a while
Baby, it's easy to fake a smile
When you've been doing it for a while

[Chorus]
Hush boy, oh hush boy
Don't say a word
Throw on a jersey
No one gets hurt
Hush girl, oh hush girl
Just bat your eyes
Play our little game
Play our little game
Hush boy, oh hush boy
Don't say a word
Throw on a jersey
No one gets hurt
Hush girl, oh hush girl
Just bat your eyes
Play our little game
Play our little game

[Post-Chorus]
Hush boy, oh hush boy (Yes now)
Hush girl, oh hush girl (Yea, put it on and play, play-play-play, play, play, play-play-play-play-play)
Play our little game
Play our little game

[Outro]
Play our little game
Play our little game
Play our little game
Won't you play with me?
