[Verse 1: Ricky Montgomery]
I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me when we're alone
You can hold my hand if no one's home
Do you like it when I'm away?
If I went and hurt my body, baby, would you love me the same?
I can feel all my bones coming back, and I'm craving motion
Mama never really learned how to live by herself
It's a curse, and it's growing
You're a pond, and I'm an ocean
Oh, all my emotions feel like explosions when you are around
And I've found a way to kill the sound, oh

[Chorus: Ricky Montgomery]
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you
Feel like you're a burden?
Oh, and if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide

[Verse 2: mxmtoon]
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
And I know that you know (Yes I know, that you know)
Listen close and move slow (Listen close and move slow)
I can't speak fast or else I'll crack
It's the price I pay for going back
And I've dreamed to be seen (I've dreamed to be seen)
Now I've got it, do I want it?

[Chorus: Ricky Montgomery & mxmtoon]
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you
Feel like you're a burden?
Oh, and if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide (I, I)

[Bridge: mxmtoon, Ricky Montgomery & both]
Darling, when you're fast asleep
I feel your dreams begin to bleed
Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it?
Tell me, is it worth it?
Is it worth it?" (Oh-oh)
'Cause there is something, and there is nothing
There is nothing in between
And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer
Watching over me, he's singing
"She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy"
Singing "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a--" (Hook)

[Chorus: Ricky Montgomery & mxmtoon]
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Oh, was it something I said to make you
Feel like you're a burden?
Oh, and if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
