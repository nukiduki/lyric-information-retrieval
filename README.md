Information Retrieval for song lyrics 

## Motivation
It's a project for my NLP & IR class.

## Description

The project is currently being started.
It is containing the following parts:

1. A collection of unstructured data

Everything related to IR will be added soon.

### Collection of Unstructured Data 

- csv of song names and their artists exported via [Exportify](https://exportify.net/#playlists)
- currently those are 1000 songs i know (It's mostly english songs with some single songs that are in other languages, that won't be a problem for information retrieval, because the songs just won't be considered as important)
- appr. 450 of the songs lyrics are retrieved with the [billboard library](https://github.com/guoguo12/billboard-charts)
- the code for this is not yet in this repo, i like keeping it to myself :)

### Information Retrieval
- TODO add when learned
