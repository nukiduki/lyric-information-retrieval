[Chorus]
I know I'm out of sight
But am I out of mind?
And when I close my eyes
I dream I'll see you in the afterlife

[Verse 1]
I'll pull those arrows from out of your back
One at a time
I know this bridge we built won't last
But it'll hold for at least a while
Even when the life leaves your bones
Your soul will follow me wherever I go
It's in the way I feel your fire even when I sleep at night
I stay inside the glow

[Chorus]
I know I'm out of sight
But am I out of mind?
And when I close my eyes
I dream I'll see you in the afterlife
I know I'm out of sight
But am I out of mind?
And when I close my eyes
I dream I'll see you in the afterlife

[Verse 2]
I'll pull those arrows from out of your back
Time and time again
We know that nothing good can last
But what'll happen when we reach the end?
I'll never let you run out of time
You'll live forever in the back of my mind
It's in the way I feel your fire even when I close my eyes
You're always there to guide me home

[Chorus]
I know I'm out of sight
But am I out of mind?
And when I close my eyes
I dream I'll see you in the afterlife
I lost a vital part of me
I lost a vital part of me
And now there's nothing left
I dream I'll see you in the afterlife

[Bridge]
I dream I'll see you in the
I dream I'll see you in the
I dream I'll see you in the
I dream I'll see you in the
I lost a vital part of me
(I dream I'll see you in the)
Lost a vital part of me
(I dream I'll see you in the)
Lost a vital part of me
(I dream I'll see you in the)
Lost a vital part of me
(I dream I'll see you in the)

[Chorus]
I know I'm out of sight
But am I out of mind?
And when I close my eyes
I dream I'll see you in the afterlife
Lost a vital part of me
Lost a vital part of me
Now there's nothing left
I dream I'll see you in the afterlife
