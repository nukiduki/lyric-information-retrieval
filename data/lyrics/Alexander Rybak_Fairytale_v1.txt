[Verse 1]
Years ago, when I was younger
I kinda liked a girl I knew
She was mine and we were sweethearts
That was then, but then it's true

[Chorus]
I'm in love with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind
I'm already cursed

[Violin Solo]

[Verse 2]
Every day, we started fighting
Every night, we fell in love
No one else could make me sadder
But no one else could lift me high above (high above)
I don't know what I was doing
When suddenly, we fell apart
Nowadays, I cannot find her
But when I do, we'll get a brand-new start

[Chorus]
I'm in love with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind
I'm already cursed

[Violin Solo]

[Bridge]
She's a fairytale, yeah
Even though it hurts
'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind
I'm already cursed

[Violin Solo]
