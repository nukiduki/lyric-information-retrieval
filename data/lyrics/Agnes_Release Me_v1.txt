[Chorus]
Release me, release my body
I know it's wrong
So why am I with you now?
I say release me
'Cause I'm not able to convince myself
That I'm better off without you

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's perfectly clear, love is not what you need
Tell you that I don't care, but I don't want to (Uh-huh)
Anything that you say (Uh-huh), I hear myself agree
And I don't recognize what I've turned into

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why I want you so
'Cause I don't need a heartbreak
I don't know what addictive hold
You have on me, I can't shake, no
I'm not in control, so let me go

[Chorus]
Release me, release my body
I know it's wrong
So why do I keep coming back?
I say release me
'Cause I'm not able to convince myself
That I'm better off without you

[Verse 2]
I could sleep by myself, it would burn me alive
Find me somebody else, but I don't want to
Try to leave out the love that goes against the grain
But I can rationalize it if I have to

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why I want you so
Oh, 'cause I don't need a heartbreak
I don't know what addictive hold
You have on me, I can't shake, no
I'm not in control, so let me go

[Chorus]
Release me, release my body
I know it's wrong
So why do I keep coming back? (Why do I keep coming back?)
I say release me
'Cause I'm not able to convince myself
That I'm better off without you

[Bridge]
(Ah-ah)
I'm not in control, so let me go

[Chorus]
Release me, release my body
I know it's wrong
So why do I keep coming back?
I say release me
'Cause I'm not able to convince myself
That I'm better off without you, oh
Release me, release my body (Release my body)
I know it's wrong
So why do I keep coming back? (Why do I keep coming back?)
I say release me
'Cause I'm not able to convince myself
That I'm better off without you
Ooh
