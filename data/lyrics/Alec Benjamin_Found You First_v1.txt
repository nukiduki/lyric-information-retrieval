[Verse 1]
Some look up at the stars and wonder if there's signs of life
On Jupiter and Mars or if we're all alone tonight
I don't care about that
All I care about is that
You're with me in the car and when you are right by my side
Don't really need the stars because your heart is all that I
Really care about, so
I just want you to know

[Chorus]
If there was other life in the galaxy
More fish swimming in the sea
I'd only have eyes for you, you'd be
Still be the only one for me
If there was other life in the universe
I'd tell them you're mine, I found you first
I'd only have eyes for you, you'd be
Still be the only one for me, mm-mm

[Verse 2]
It's infinite, the depth inside your soul, it never ends
To know you is to know that there's no way I could pretend
I could ever go back
I can't ever go back
I'm infinitely falling for you, intimately close
Like planets, I revolve around you, gravity's got hold
And it won't let me go (No, it won't let me go)
I just want you to know

[Chorus]
If there was other life in the galaxy
More fish swimming in the sea
I'd only have eyes for you, you'd be
Still be the only one for me
If there was other life in the universe
I'd tell them you're mine, I found you first
I'd only have eyes for you, you'd be
Still be the only one for me

[Bridge]
There's no place I could find
Someone as one of a kind
You're the only one on my mind
You're the only one on my mind

[Chorus]
If there was other life in the galaxy
More fish swimming in the sea
I'd only have eyes for you, you'd be
Still be the only one for me
If there was other life in the universe
I'd tell them you're mine, I found you first
I'd only have eyes for you, you'd be
Still be the only one for me, mm-mm

[Outro]
Ba-um, da-dum, da-dum, mm
