Open the door, walk in behind her
Draw back your bow, let it remind her
No ones around, no need to fake it
She's not in love, how can she take it
Give her the time, she'll know you mean it
Make up her mind, throw in her feelings
Open the door, have her jump through it
She fell in love, how could she do it
Do you know
Do you know what you're missing
What you're missing will show
If you should try to kiss her

Do you know
Do you know what you're missing
What you're missing will show
If you should try to kiss her
You should try to kiss her
Crazies galore, you wouldn't do it
Seen it before, looks like you blew it

Do you know
Do you know what you're missing
What you're missing will show
If you should try to kiss her

Do you know
Do you know what you're missing
What you're missing will show
If you should try to kiss her
You should try to kiss her

Do you know
Do you know what you're missing
What you're missing will show
If you should try to kiss her

Do you know
Do you know what you're missing
What you're missing will show
If you should try to kiss her
You should try to kiss her
Just put up your fister
You should try to kiss her goodbye
