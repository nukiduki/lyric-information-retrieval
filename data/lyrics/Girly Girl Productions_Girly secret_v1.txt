[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a girly girl with a girly secret
If I tell it to you, promise that you'll keep it?
I'll tell you now, my little secret is, is, is, is

[Chorus]
I accidentally killed a man
I had to hide the body in my pink glitter van
To be honest, it felt kinda good
I want to kill again, but I don't know if I should

[Refrain]
I wear his clothes from time to time
His top was Y2K, so divine
I am a Y2K girl, I do a Y2K twirl
I love being a girl

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a girly girl with a girly secret
If I tell it to you, promise that you'll keep it?
I'll tell you now, my little secret is, is, is, is

[Chorus]
I accidentally killed that man on purpose
I feel like killing is my life's purpose
To be honest, it felt kinda good
I want to kill again, but I don't know if I should
I accidentally killed that man on purposе
I feel like killing is my life's purpose
To bе honest, it felt kinda good
I want to kill again, but I don't know if I should

[Refrain]
I wear his clothes from time to time
His top was Y2K, so divine
I am a Y2K girl, I do a Y2K twirl
I love being a girl

[Chorus]
I accidentally killed that man on purpose
I feel like killing is my life's purpose
To be honest, it felt kinda good
I want to kill again, but I don't know if I should
