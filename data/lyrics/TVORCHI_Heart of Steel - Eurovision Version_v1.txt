[Verse 1]
Sometimes gotta let it go
Sometimes gotta look away
Sometimes you just gotta know
When to stick your middle finger up in the air
I cannot explain
Tell you how I feel (Oh, I)
Life is just a game (Oh, yeah)
And I'm playing for the win (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be scared to say just what you think
'Cause no matter how bad, someone's listening

[Chorus]
Don't care what you say
Don't care how you feel
Get out of my way
'Cause I got a heart of steel

[Post-Chorus]
Don't care what you say
Or how you feel
Oh, I got a heart of steel, uh-uh

[Verse 2]
(Oh, I) You just like to act a fool
Tryna get in my head like
When I turn on my headlights
I can see right through you
Tryna get a reaction
I just hit the action move

[Bridge]
Незважаючи на біль
Я продовжую свій бій
Світ палає, а ти дій

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be scarеd to say just what you think
'Cause no matter how bad, someonе's listening

[Chorus]
Don't care what you say
Don't care how you feel
Get out of my way
'Cause I got a heart of steel

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Don't care what you say
Or how you feel
Oh, I got a heart of steel, uh-uh-uh
