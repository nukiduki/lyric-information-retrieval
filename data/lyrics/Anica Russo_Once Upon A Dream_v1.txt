[Verse 1]
There was a child that reached for the stars
So afraid of falling
She got hurt, lost trust in the world
And the lights went off one by one
She got hurt, sost trust in the world
And the lights went off one by one

[Verse 2]
But there was a fire that grew from the dark
So she kept on trying

[Chorus]
Only a spark can light up a heart
And her dreams came true one by one
Only a spark can light up a heart
And her dreams came true one by one

[Interlude]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Know this life would leave a bruise
But it's thе life she'd always choose
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
All thе things she wanna, all the things she wanna do
Are all the things she gonna, all the things she gonna do

[Chorus]
Only a spark can light up a heart
And her dreams came true one by one

[Bridge]
But she had a fire that grew from the dark
So she kept on fighting
Only one spark to light up the stars
And her dreams came true one by one

[Chorus]
Only a spark can light up a heart
And her dreams came true one by one
