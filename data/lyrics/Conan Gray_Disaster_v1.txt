[Verse 1]
Let me just set the scene
I'd just left the party at Blake's and it's Halloween
Had the keys to my car in my hand, but I didn't leave
'Cause the potential of us, it was keeping me up all night long
I left a text you won't read all night long

[Chorus]
This could be a disaster
There's so many factors, like, what if you freak out
And then we're losin' it all at the critical chapter
Where I say, "I love you" and you don't say it after?
This could be a disaster
I'm pedaling backwards by sayin' that "I'm drunk
I really shouldn't have called," I'm a little bit plastered
You call me a liar, now I'm fallin' in faster
This could be a disaster

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, disaster
Oh-oh-oh, disaster

[Verse 2]
Let me just lose my mind
Is it purely platonic to call me, like, every night?
You know, Ashley believes that there's something between you and I
But if I'm readin' it wrong, then it'd be better off if I died, oh
And if you're readin' the text all night long

[Chorus]
This could be a disaster
There's so many factors, like, what if you freak out
And then we're losin' it all at the critical chapter
Where I say, "I love you" and you don't say it after?
This could be a disaster
I'm pedaling backwards by sayin' that "I'm drunk
I really shouldn't have called," I'm a little bit plastered
You call me a liar, now I'm fallin' in faster
This could be a disaster

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, disaster
Oh-oh-oh, disaster

[Outro]
Maybe I'm mistaken (Oh-oh-oh)
You're not mine for takin' (Oh-oh-oh)
Maybe I'm mistaken
Maybe I just made it up, messed it up
