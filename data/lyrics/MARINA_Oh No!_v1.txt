[Verse 1]
Don't do love, don't do friends
I'm only after success
Don't need a relationship
I'll never soften my grip

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't want cash, don't want card
Want it fast, want it hard
Don't need money, don't need fame
I just want to make a change
I just wanna change, I just wanna change
I just wanna change, I just wanna change
I just wanna change

[Chorus]
I know exactly what I want and who I want to be
I know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine
I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!

[Verse 2]
One track mind, one track heart
If I fail, I'll fall apart
Maybe it is all a test
'Cause I feel like I'm the worst
So I always act like I'm the best

[Pre-Chorus]
If you are not very careful
Your possessions will possess you
TV taught me how to feel
Now real life has no appeal
It has no appeal, it has no appeal
It has no appeal, it has no appeal
It has no appeal

[Chorus]
I know exactly what I want and who I want to be
I know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine
I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!
I know exactly (Da-da-da, da-da-da)
What I want and who I want to be (Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
I know exactly (Da-da-da, da-da-da)
Why I walk and talk like a machine (Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
I'm now becoming (Da-da-da, da-da-da)
My own self-fulfilled prophecy (Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!

[Bridge]
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna fail, I'm gonna die
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna fail, gonna die, die, die, die

[Chorus]
I know exactly what I want and who I want to be
I know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine
I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!
I know exactly (Da-da-da, da-da-da)
What I want and who I want to be (Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
I know exactly (Da-da-da, da-da-da)
Why I walk and talk like a machine (Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
I'm now becoming (Da-da-da, da-da-da)
My own self-fulfilled prophecy (Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!

[Outro]
(Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
(Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
(Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!
