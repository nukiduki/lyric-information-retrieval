[Verse 1]
We got a lot of time to get it right
It feels good to mess it up, maybe don't think about it
Going late night, who needs a fantasy?
Buzzing on Hennessy, drives like a Kennedy
And you're my nation, my revolution
Living right now, well, you can call it disillusion

[Pre-Chorus]
Until tomorrow comes
This is how we run

[Chorus]
So take the good stuff, honey
That money just won't buy
Spend it up, up however we like
Take the good stuff, honey
That money just won't buy
Don't try to save us 'cause we're doing it right
We are, we are the wasted youth
We are, we are the wasted youth

[Post-Chorus]
It's my life
If I'm gonna waste it
Gonna waste it on you
It's my life
If I'm gonna waste it
I'll be wasted on you

[Verse 2]
Look what you did to me, a rebel born free
Running wild through the concrete jungle
Now I can't seem to stay away
Hell, I know that I'm gonna pay
But I do it anyway (Anyway, anyway)

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the ultimate high that I'm trippin' on
You're the edge of the cliff that I'm hangin' on
Until tomorrow comes
This is how we run

[Chorus]
So take the good stuff, honey
That money just won't buy
Spend it up, up however we like
Take the good stuff, honey
That money just won't buy
Don't try to save us 'cause we're doing it right
We are, we are the wasted youth
We are, we are the wasted youth

[Post-Chorus]
It's my life
If I'm gonna waste it
Gonna waste it on you
It's my life
If I'm gonna waste it
I'll be wasted on you

[Interlude]
On you, on you
Wasted on you
On you, on you
Wasted on you

[Bridge]
I tell myself, if I'm gonna fall
It'll be from high places
Even when it hurts, at least we loved hard
Now, didn't we, baby?

[Chorus]
We are, we are the wasted youth
We are, we are the wasted youth
We are, we are the wasted youth
We are, we are the wasted youth

[Post-Chorus]
It's my life
If I'm gonna waste it
Gonna waste it on you
It's my life
If I'm gonna waste it
I'll be wasted on you
