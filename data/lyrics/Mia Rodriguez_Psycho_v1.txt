[Verse 1]
I'll wear all pink to your white wedding
I'll dance all night and do something upsetting
I'll laugh when you kick me out
It's been the third time already

[Pre-Chorus]
Running home, I laugh alone
At least I stole the show

[Chorus]
Part of me wanna to do stupid shit
Gotta admit, I'm a hypocrite
I like it way better than being on the side of it
I'm a psycho, loving it
Part of me wanna to do stupid shit
Gotta admit, I'm a hypocrite
I like it way better than being on the side of it
I'm a psycho, loving it

[Verse 2]
Can't wait to hear what they call me
Call me names and make up all these stories
I would kill for a life that ain't boring
I'm lots of things but not sorry

[Pre-Chorus]
Running home, I laugh alone
At least I stole the show

[Chorus]
Part of me wanna to do stupid shit
Gotta admit, I'm a hypocrite
I like it way better than being on the side of it
I'm a psycho, loving it
Part of me wanna to do stupid shit
Gotta admit, I'm a hypocrite
I like it way better than being on the side of it
I'm a psycho, loving it

[Bridge]
Time of my life
We're all just skeletons
Just joining the fight for the adrenaline
The time of my life
We're all just skeletons
Just joining the fight
Joining the fight

[Chorus]
Part of me wanna to do stupid shit
Gotta admit, I'm a hypocrite
I like it way better than being on the side of it
I'm a psycho, loving it
Part of me wanna to do stupid shit
Gotta admit, I'm a hypocrite
I like it way better than being on the side of it
I'm a psycho, loving it

[Outro]
I'm a psycho, loving it
