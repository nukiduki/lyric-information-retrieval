[Verse 1]
Don't stray, don't ever go away
I should be much too smart for this
You know it gets the better of me
Sometimes, when you and I collide
I fall into an ocean of you
Pull me out in time

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let me drown, let me down
I say it's all because of you

[Chorus]
Say you'll stay
Don't come and go, like you do
Sway my way
Yeah, I need to know all about you

[Verse 2]
And here I go now, losing my control
I'm practicing your name
So I can say it to your face
It doesn't seem right to look you in the eye
Let all the things you mean to me
Come tumbling out my mouth indeed

[Pre-Chorus]
It's time, tell you why
I say it's infinitely true

[Chorus]
Say you'll stay
Don't come and go, like you do
Sway my way
Yeah, I need to know all about you

[Bridge]
It's all because of you
It's all because of you

[Pre-Chorus]
And now it all turns sour
Come sweeten every afternoon
It's time, tell you why
I say it's infinitely true

[Chorus]
Say you'll stay
Don't come and go, like you do
Sway my way
Yeah, I need to know all about you
Say you'll stay
Don't come and go, like you do
Sway my way
Yeah, I need to know all about you

[Outro]
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
