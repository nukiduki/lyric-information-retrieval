[Verse 1]
Ten out of ten, all in a line
The air is sweet when we're passing by, yeah, ooh
It hurts a little, don't get whiplash
Don't forget that
Saltwater skin, hair in the breeze
Go eat your heart out like tangerines, yeah, ooh
Let's break the tension like a Kit Kat
Yeah, you feel that?

[Pre-Chorus]
Save a kiss for the sun
Don't you wish you could come undone?
Take a dip, join the fun
Just as long as you know that

[Chorus]
Summer's for the girls, the girls that like girls
The girls that like boys, the girls, the girls, the girls
Summer's for thе girls that run the night, girls
The change your lifе girls (Yeah), the girls, the girls, the girls

[Verse 2]
(Ooh) Don't wipe out, one look and it's lights out
What's everyone gonna do, let's find out
It's not wrong, it's right now
It's not wrong, it's right now

[Pre-Chorus]
Way it hits on your tongue (Oh, yeah)
Don't you wish you could come undone?
Take a dip (Take a dip), join the fun (Join the fun)
Just as long as you know that

[Chorus]
Summer's for the girls, the girls that like girls
The girls that like boys, the girls, the girls, the girls
Summer's for the girls that run the night, girls
The change your life girls (Yeah), the girls, the girls, the girls

[Post-Chorus]
Surround me with the girls, I love being a girl
I'm ready for the girls, are you? (Ooh-ooh)
Surround me with the girls, I love being a girl
I'm ready for the girls, are you? (The girls, the girls, the girls)

[Bridge]
Take a dip, join the fun
Just as long as you know

[Chorus]
Summer's for the girls, the girls that like girls
The girls that like boys, the girls, the girls, the girls
Summer's for the girls that run the night, girls
The change your life girls (Yeah), the girls, the girls, the girls

[Post-Chorus]
Surround me with the girls, I love being a girl
I'm ready for the girls, are you? (Ooh-ooh)
Surround me with the girls, I love being a girl
I'm ready for the girls, are you? (The girls, the girls, the girls)
