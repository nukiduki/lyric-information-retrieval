[Verse 1]
Draw the blinds, light every candle
Slip off my pretty dress down my chest when I think of you
Every night, both lips on the mirror
It's ritualistic, counting lipstick stains where you should be

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I need you around
I'm getting close now

[Chorus]
Do you picture me like I picture you? (Oh)
Am I in the frame from your point of view? (Oh)
Do you feel the same? I'm too scared to say (Oh)
Half of the things I do when I picture you

[Verse 2]
So, tell me now (Tell me now) all your perversions (Oh, oh)
Am I doing research in a mini skirt (Am I?) at the library in your hometown?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I need you around
I'm getting close now

[Chorus]
Do you picture me like I picture you? (Oh)
Am I in the frame from your point of view? (Oh)
Do you feel the same? I'm too scared to say (Oh)
Half of the things I do when I picture you

[Bridge]
When I picture you
Aah, aah
Aah
Aah, aah
Aah

[Chorus]
Do you picture me like I picture you?
Am I in the frame from your point of view?
Do you feel the same? I'm too scared to say
Half of the things I do when I picture you
