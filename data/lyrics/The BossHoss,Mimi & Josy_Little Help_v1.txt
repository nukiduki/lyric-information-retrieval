[Verse 1: The BossHoss]
Wanna get the full devotion 'cause it's taking you higher
Wanna get the most of all to gratify your desire
Wanna get the most admiration, the biggest slice
The most likes, check you out, you're a public sell out
Wanna get the full attention, please your narcissism
Wanna get the full spot to show us what you do in your kitchen
Wanna get the 24/7 full-on limelight
By giving up your private life

[Chorus: Mimi & Josy]
If you need a little love my friend
Come along I will understand
If you need a little faith, my dear
Come along I will be here
And if you need a little help that'll never end
Come along and take my hand
If you need a little love I'll be your friend

[Verse 2: The BossHoss]
Wanna get the most of showing off by showing your stuff
Wanna get response and praise and virtual embraces
Wanna get your life judged and rated by unknown faces
Zeroed in by anonymous phrases
Wanna get control of your virtual life
Wanna get the thumb up or down for your emotional drive
Wanna get your kicks out of pics people share in reply
What's the sense, please tell me why?

[Chorus: Mimi & Josy]
If you need a little love my friend
Come along I will understand
If you need a little faith, my dear
Come along I will be here
And if you need a little help that'll never end
Come along and take my hand
If you need a little love I'll be your friend

[Bridge: The BossHoss]
Don't give yourself away and your personality
If someone pulls the plug you'll end up sad and lonely
On your couch in the hotspot front row
Think you're a hero and you really want the world to know
I'll be your friend, I'll be your friend, your friend

[Verse 3: The BossHoss, Mimi & Josy]
Wanna get the fame of a VIP and you're paying the price
But it's just fame in a frame till your batterie dies
Wanna get the max of clicks and you chat and you chase
But when I talk to you, you can't even look in my face
Without your device you don't know how to think
Gotta check your insta friends, 'cause you're an influenced thing
But you never get what you see when they're posing real cool
Get a life you little fool

[Chorus: Mimi & Josy]
If you need a little love my friend
Come along I will understand
If you need a little faith, my dear
Come along I will be here
And if you need a little help that'll never end
Come along and take my hand
If you need a little love I'll be your friend

[Outro: Mimi & Josy]
If you need a little love
If you need a little love
If you need a little love
If you need a little love
If you need a little love
If you need a little love
I'll be your friend
