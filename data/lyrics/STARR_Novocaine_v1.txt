Never really loved you like I said I did
Never liked your taste but I still took a hit
It’s all the same
When your blurring out the lines

Never really ever wanted you to stay
Never even thought l’d even feel this way
Needle in
To numb all of the fucking pain

I hit you like Novocaine

[Instrumental Break]

Burning sensation
Tingling in my veins yeah

Try to escape
Try to escape
So I don’t feel it
Self medicate
Self medicatе yeah

Try to forget it
With human anesthеtic
Suffocating me
In grenadine
Sweeten my sadness
My demons
Screaming telling me I

Never really loved you like I said I did
Never liked your taste but I still took a hit
It’s all the same
When your blurring out the lines

Never really ever wanted u to stay
Never even thought l’d even feel this way
Needle in
To numb all of the fucking pain

I hit you like Novocaine
I hit you like Novocaine
I hit you like Novocaine

[Instrumental Break]

Drag me through the mud
Cuts on my face
The misery swims through my veins
Digging myself
Out of the grave
I can’t escape it

Oh oh oh oh
I hit you like Novocaine
Oh oh oh oh
I hit you like Novocaine

Never really loved you like I said I did
Never liked your taste but I still took a hit
It’s all the same
When your blurring out the lines

I hit you like Novocaine
