[Verse 1]
What's worse?
Bein' wanted but not loved
Or loved but not wanted?
What's worse?
Hearin' what you wanna hear
Or hearin' what's honest?

[Pre-Chorus]
Our love's misaligned 'cause you're on my mind
Every night
I ignore the signs and I don't know why
'Cause, baby, I

[Chorus]
I saw the end when we began
You couldn't love the way I can
I tried to bargain with the stars
For more than half your heart
But you have more pieces of me than the desert has sand
And I have less pieces of you than I can hold in my hand

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
What hurts
Is the one thing that you wanna do
Is the one thing that you shouldn't do
What hurts
Is knowin' what's good for you
Just doesn't look good to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Our love's misaligned 'cause you're on my mind
Every night
I stretch out the time and now I know why
'Cause, baby, I

[Chorus]
I saw the end when we began
You couldn't love the way I can
I tried to bargain with the stars
For more than half your heart
But you have more pieces of me than the desert has sand
And I have less pieces of you than I can hold in my hand

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
What's worse? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Bein' wanted but not loved
Or loved but not wanted? (Ooh)
What's worse?
Hearin' what you wanna hear (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Or hearin' what's honest?

[Chorus]
I saw the end when we began
You couldn't love the way I can
Tried to bargain with the stars
For more than half your heart
But you have more pieces of me than the desert has sand
And I have less pieces of you
Oh, I have less pieces of you than I can hold in my hand
