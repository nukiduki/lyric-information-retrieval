[Verse 1]
People ask me what it's like
Knowin' you
And how I hold myself at night
Watchin' you
Knowin' how I lost myself
Wantin' you
And how I always lose myself
Wantin' you

[Verse 2]
The city sky is hangin' low, it seems to know
I'm findin' comfort where I can with all these ghosts
I just wanna be alone when lights dim low
And I go home, and I go home

[Chorus]
Oh my God
Take me back the way that I was
Oh my God
You know I only tried to play your games
So you cannot forget my name
You and I are not the same
You always had it easy

[Post-Chorus]
Oh my God
Take me back the way that I was
The way that I was

[Verse 3]
I don't often use your name, but I'm cravin' to
And all these strangers look the same, but I look for you
As I'm crawlin' through the streets, it's a lonely view
And I feel so blue, I feel so blue

[Bridge]
My baby don't look for me
When I get lost on all these streets
See myself, but it's not me
I'm with the crowd, I cannot breathe
My baby's no good for me
No good for me, no good for me
My baby's no good for me
And nothing's ever easy

[Chorus]
Oh my God
Take me back the way that I was
Oh my God
You know I'm inside and I'm in between
What you want, I can't compete
You cross the line and I repeat
You've always had it easy
Easy
You make me feel so sleazy
You've always had it easy
You make me feel so sleazy

[Post-Chorus]
Oh my God
Take me back the way that I was
The way that I was
