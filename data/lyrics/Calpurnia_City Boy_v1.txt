[Verse 1]
When I walk around my room
There is nothing else to say
When I walk around my room
Everything will be okay, ow!

[Chorus]
I am a city boy
You are a city girl
You date the city tool
I am a city fool

I am a
City boy
City boy

(One, two, three, four!)

[Verse 2]
When you have an artistic view
Itâ€™ll rub off on your take
When you answer to a bunch of dudes
You should run away

[Chorus]
I am a city boy
You are a city girl
You date the city tool

I am a
City fool
I am a
City fool
I am a
City fool
I am a, I am a
City fool
I am a, I am a
City, city fool
