[Intro]
One more take then
Lauren's gonna roll a doobie
A dubious doobie

[Verse 1]
Red beady eyes cut through the smoke
Under my hood, nobody knows
Except for me in my grim reaper robe
It feels so good dancing alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Halloween, fog machine, couldn't see anything
Dramamine, make-believe, I can do anything

[Chorus]
I feel so dumb, so in my head
Right next to you, I'll just pretend
I feel so lucky to have a friend
Don't leave before me, stay 'til the end

[Post-Chorus]
Ba, ba-ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba

[Verse 2]
Two little kids, two fluid forms
Two little rascals caught in a rainstorm
I've got a secret, I want you to know
But I'll never say it, too insecure

[Pre-Chorus]
Halloween, fog machine, couldn't see anything (Couldn't see anything, couldn't see anything)
Dramamine, make-believe, I can do anything (I can do anything, I can do anything)

[Chorus]
I feel so dumb, so in my head
Right next to you, I'll just pretend
I feel so lucky to have a friend
Don't leave before me, stay 'til the end

[Post-Chorus]
Ba, ba-ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba

[Pre-Chorus]
Halloween, fog machine, couldn't see anything (Couldn't see anything, couldn't see anything)
Dramamine, make-believe, I can do anything

[Chorus]
I feel so dumb (So dumb), so in my head
Right next to you, I'll just pretend
I feel so lucky (So dumb) to have a friend
Don't leave before me, stay 'til the end

[Post-Chorus]
Ba, ba-ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba, ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba
