[Verse 1]
I've been hanging pictures of you on my wall
Drawing crosses on your eyes like a sinner, oh
I was young and you'd spit venom in my face
You shoulda known that that would leave a bitter taste

[Pre-Chorus]
Hoo-ooh, you always see the worst
Hoo-ooh-ooh, won't let you kill me first

[Chorus]
You are dead to me 'cause what you said to me
Cut so deep and now you're dead to me
Dead to me, you were a friend to me
But I put you to sleep and now you're dead to me
It's a shame, you're to blame
You made the rules, but still fucked up your own damn game

[Post-Chorus]
(Dead to me)
(Dead to me)

[Verse 2]
When did we decide to skip the niceties?
Or were there even times when you were nice to me? (No)
So, go be shady and I'll be the monster that you made me (So, shady)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hoo-ooh, you always see the worst
Hoo-ooh-ooh, won't let you kill me first

[Chorus]
You are dead to me 'cause what you said to me
Cut so deep and now you're dead to me
Dead to me, you were a friend to me
But I put you to sleep and now you're dead to me
It's a shame, you're to blame
You made the rules, but still fucked up your own damn game

[Post-Chorus]
(Dead to me)
(Dead to me)

[Outro]
Dead to me, said to me
Cut so deep, dead to me
Dead to me, friend to me
You to sleep, dead to me
