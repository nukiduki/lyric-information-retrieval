[Refrain]
Anxiety, keep on tryin' me
I feel it quietly
Tryin' to silence me, yeah
My anxiety, can't shake it off of me
Somebody's watchin' me
And my anxiety, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Solo, no mojo
I bounce back, no pogo
Unhappy, no homo
New brands, no logos
Money on my jugular, natural hustler
Think I need a smuggler up in Russia
You could be my butler, shine my cutla'
Shout out to Oyenda, that's the guzzler
Okay, next thing, my life is a wet dream
I call it a sex scene, the back is a nice tease
I tried to escape, my life is a X-rate
I'm sorry, a sex tape, you only get one take

[Interlude]
Quiet on the set, please
Rolling "Anxiety"
In three, two, one

[Refrain]
Anxiety, keep on tryin' me
I feel it quietly
Tryin' to silence me, yeah
Anxiety, shake it off of me
Somebody's watchin' me
It's my anxiety, yeah (Brrah)

[Chorus]
Anxiety, anxiet—, oh, I feel it tryin' (Oh)
Keep it tryin', keep it tryin'
Oh, I feel the silence (Oh)
Keep it quiet, keep it tired, oh, somebody's touchin' me (Ooh, la-da, woah)
Anxiety, anxiet—, oh, I feel anxiet— (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
My anxiety, anxiet—, oh, I feel it tryin' (It's my anxiety, can't let it conquer me)
Keep it tryin', keep it tryin', oh, I feel the silence (It's my anxiety, gotta shake it off of me)
Keep it quiet, keep it quiet, oh, somebody's watchin' me (It's my anxiety, can't let it caution me)
Anxiety, anxiet—, oh, I feel anxiety (It's my anxiety, gotta keep it off of me)
Anxiety, anxiet—, oh, I feel it tryin'
Keep it tryin', keep it tryin'
Oh, I feel the silence
Keep it quiet, keep it quiet
Oh, somebody's watching me
Anxiety, anxiet—, oh, I feel anxiety

[Verse 2]
Court order from Florid-er
What's in that clear blue water?
No limits, no borders
What's in that new world order?
Marco (Marco), Polo (Polo)
Negro run from popo (Popo)
That blue light and that rojo (Rojo)

[Bridge]
And it's like
I get this tightness in my chest
Like an elephant is standing on me
And I just let it take over
Anxiety keeps on trying me
Anxiety keeps on trying me, yeah

[Chorus]
Anxiety, anxiet—, oh, I feel it tryin' (Ooh)
Keep it tryin', keep it tryin' (Oh)
Oh, I feel the silence
Keep it quiet, keep it quiet
Oh, somebody's watchin' me (Oh, it keeps on trying me)
Anxiety, anxiet—, oh, I feel anxiet— (It keeps on trying, t-trying, trying, oh)
My anxiety, it's my anxiety, can't shake it off of me (It's my anxiety)
It's my anxiety, gotta keep it off of me (Can't shake it off of me)
It's my anxiety, can't shake it off of me (Oh; somebody's watchin' me)
It's my anxiety, gotta keep it off of me (Brrah)

[Outro]
Can't shake it off of me, shake, shake it off of me
It's my anxiety, gotta keep it off of me
Can't shake it off of me, shake, shake it off of me
It's my anxiety, gotta shake it off of me
Me
Me
