[Intro]
Listen well, all of you

[Chorus]
Comin' with the bad bitch magic (Yeah)
And they can't stand it when I put these hoes in a panic
Somethin' 'bout it so romantic (Yeah)
Keepin' it classic, maybe I'm the next Cate Blanchett
Comin' with the bad bitch magic (Yeah)
I'ma let you grab it, feelin' like a bitch telepathic
Know I'm gonna slay, goddammit (Yeah)
I be so candid, gentle, but a bitch do damage

[Verse 1]
Abracadabra (Ooh)
These bitches know I got answers (Ooh)
The way I pose for the cameras (Ooh)
They be like, ''Whoa,'' like, ''Whoa''
And just when they thought it was safe (Ooh)
I pull out my wand and my capе (Ooh)
I don't let these bitchеs escape me (Ooh)
Hell to the no

[Pre-Chorus]
Game over
Put chills in your bones, I told ya
Come quick like a cold October
Don't leave me alone, come closer, come closer
I'm on ya (You)
Like moth to a flame, you a goner
Go numb, lidocaine, no drama
Pickin' up on a whole new genre, new genre

[Chorus]
Comin' with the bad bitch magic (Ooh, yeah)
And they can't stand it when I put these hoes in a panic
Somethin' 'bout it so romantic (Yeah)
Keepin' it classic, maybe I'm the next Cate Blanchett
Comin' with the bad bitch magic (Yeah)
I'ma let you grab it, feelin' like a bitch telepathic
Know I'm gonna slay, goddammit (Yeah)
I be so candid, gentle, but a bitch do damage

[Verse 2]
Abracadabra (Ooh)
These bitches know I got standards (Ooh)
But I'm a fuckin' disaster
And that's how I like it (That's how she likes it, yeah)
I'm tired of being polite (Ooh)
My manners go bump in the night (Ooh)
'Cause bad bitches can't be too kind
It's a no for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Game over
Put chills in your bones, I told ya
Come quick like a cold October
Don't leave me alone, come closer, come closer
I'm on ya
Like moth to a flame, you a goner (Yeah)
Go numb, lidocaine, no drama
Pickin' up on a whole new genre, new genre

[Chorus]
Comin' with the bad bitch magic (Ooh)
And they can't stand it when I put these hoes in a panic
Somethin' 'bout it so romantic (Yeah)
Keepin' it classic, maybe I'm the next Cate Blanchett (Ow)
Comin' with the bad bitch magic (Yeah)
I'ma let you grab it, feelin' like a bitch telepathic (Whoa, whoa)
Know I'm gonna slay, goddammit (Yeah)
I be so candid, gentle, but a bitch do damage

[Outro]
Na-na, na-na-na
Know I'm gonna slay, goddammit
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Bitch feelin' telepathic
Na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Abracadabra
Don't know what's come over me lately
I just feel, like, out of control, like
Like, ah!
