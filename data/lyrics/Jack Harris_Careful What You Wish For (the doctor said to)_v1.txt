[Verse 1]
I miss my old emotions
I miss the pain I used to have
I'm going through the motions
I'd sell my soul to make me sad

[Pre-Chorus]
I needed something
To help me get through
I wanted something
And the doctor said to

[Chorus]
Take this pill, you'll feel much better
When you wake up numb and your brain's been severed
And your heartbeat won't be based on the weather
When you sell yourself to me
Took your peace, your pain, your pleasure
And I left you with one face forеver
You won't hurt anymore, be carеful what you wish for

[Verse 2]
Something is missing, there's predisposition
I feel like I'm living inside of my head
How can they sell you on something, they help you
Then tell you it might make you wish you were—?

[Pre-Chorus]
I needed something
To help me get through
I wanted something
And the doctor said to

[Chorus]
Take this pill, you'll feel much better
When you wake up numb and your brain's been severed
And your heartbeat won't be based on the weather
When you sell yourself to me
Took your peace, your pain, your pleasure
And I left you with one face forever
You won't hurt anymore, be careful what you wish for

[Post-Chorus]
Be careful, be careful
Be careful what you wish for
Be careful, be careful
Be careful what you wish for

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Be careful, be careful
Be careful what you wish for
Be careful, be careful
Be careful what you wish for
