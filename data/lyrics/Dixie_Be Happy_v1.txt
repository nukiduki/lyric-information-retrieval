[Intro]
Sometimes I don't wanna be happy
Don't hold it against me
If I'm down, just leave me there
Let me be sad

[Verse 1]
Sun's up, I already wanna lay down
Friends calling, I ain't really tryna go out (No)
Don't wanna get dressed up to pretend (No)
I could lie and say I'm fine
Maybe you'll stop calling then

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got chips on my shoulder
Only getting older
So I keep to myself
Ain't tryna complain
Just don't wanna explain it

[Chorus]
But sometimes I don't wanna be happy
Don't hold it against me
If I'm down, just leave me there
Let me be sad
Sometimes I just wanna be lonely
Don't need you to hold me
If I'm low, you don't need to care
Let me be sad

[Post-Chorus]
What's the matter with that? (Oh, oh, oh)
What's the matter with that? (Oh, oh, oh)
What's the matter with

[Verse 2]
Bad days, it's okay, let me feel it (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
In some ways, you've got to break your heart to heal it (Heal it)
I know I'm gonna feel this way again
I can lie and say I'm fine
But that wouldn't change anything

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got chips on my shoulder
Only getting older
So I keep to myself
Ain't tryna complain
Just don't wanna explain it

[Chorus]
But sometimes I don't wanna be happy
Don't hold it against me
If I'm down, just leave me there
Let me be sad
Sometimes I just wanna be lonely
Don't need you to hold me
If I'm low, you don't need to care
Let me be sad

[Post-Chorus]
What's the matter with that? (Oh, oh, oh)
What's the matter with that? (Oh, oh, oh)

[Bridge]
What's the matter with sadness?
Making me feel the way I feel right now
Gladness
Can't force it when you feel fucked up
It's the salt that's on my tongue
It's the salt that's on my tongue
But

[Chorus]
Sometimes I don't wanna be happy
Don't hold it against me
If I'm down, just leave me there
Let me be sad (Let me be sad)
Sometimes I just wanna be lonely
Don't need you to hold me
If I'm low, you don't need to care
Let me be sad

[Outro]
What's the matter with that? (Oh, oh, oh)
What's the matter with that? (Oh, oh, oh)
Just let me be sad
