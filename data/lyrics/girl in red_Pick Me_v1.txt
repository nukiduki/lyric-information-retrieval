[Intro]
Pick me over him
Let the loser win
I have so many things I wanna say
But don't know how to communicate
Pick me over him
Let the loser win
I'm always waitin' for you to say
My insecurities drove you away

[Verse 1]
I'm worried about it
Of course I'm embarrassed
I'm hiding the madness
I'm hiding it all from you
Yeah, how could I ever be true?

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no amount of validation that would make this go away
The endless fear of losin' you to him
Is keeping me awake

[Chorus]
So why, you're leaving with him?
And I guess he's got something I can't give
I might be falling apart
I think you know I havе been from the start

[Verse 2]
Pick me over him
Wish I could bе your prince
I'm freaking out, like, "Where have you been?"
Can't stop my mind and the way that it spins

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's no reason for me to be acting up the way that I am
But jealousy has gotten to me again
It doesn't make any sense

[Chorus]
So why, you're leaving with him?
I guess he's got something I can't give
I might be falling apart
I think you know I have been from the start

[Outro]
Let the loser win
Let me be your prince
Time stands still within
When you leave with him
