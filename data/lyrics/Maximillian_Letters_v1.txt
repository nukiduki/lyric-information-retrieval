[Verse 1]
Same place but something's different
Yeah I noticed something's off
So fast I almost missed it
But it's too late and now you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
I spilled another glass of wine
Killed the lights to pass the time
'Cause you're not here to ask me how I feel

[Chorus]
I still hope you read my letters
That they bring you peace at night
Even at our darkest hour
I know that we'll be alright

[Verse 2]
Makes no sense, I don't believe it
Is it true that thеy can just take you away
Walls were nеver made for freedom
And I'll break every single one to see your face

[Pre-Chorus]
And I will hold the hourglass
Counting every grain of sand
'Cause nothing feels the same until you're home

[Chorus]
I still hope you read my letters
That they bring you peace at night
Even at our darkest hour
I know that we'll be alright

[Bridge]
So many faces to remember
But yours is the only one I know
The one I believe in
The place I call home

[Outro]
I'll light a light for you tonight
Send out a prayer in my mind
'Cause I know we'll be alright
