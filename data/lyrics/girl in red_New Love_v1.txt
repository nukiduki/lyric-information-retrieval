[Verse 1]
I don't wanna know about your new love
Quitting you was harder than I ever thought it'd be
I don't wanna walk away and leave you to your new love
I've been in denial, but now it's hitting me

[Chorus]
Nothing makes more sense
Than to be in your arms again
Some things never end
Will I learn to love again?

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna hear about your new love
Something 'bout it makes me want to chop my own ears off
Do you really think I can't tell you're not yourself when she's there?
How am I supposed to believe you're head over heels for someone like her?

[Chorus]
Nothing makes more sense
Than to be in your arms again
Desperate for the day
My love won't go to waste

[Outro]
Nothing makes more sense
Than to be in your arms again
You break and bend
My heart because you can
