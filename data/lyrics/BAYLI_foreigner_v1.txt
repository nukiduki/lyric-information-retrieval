[Intro]
Foreigner, hold me up
Met you in the night, lower east side
Owning up, told me it was your wedding night
We were both high
We don't need explanations tonight
We don't no expectations tonight

[Verse 1]
You were so lost when we met in SoHo (Met in SoHo)
Ordered two drinks, even though you were drinkin' solo
There was something in your aura coming forward
Asked if you had a girl
Say you wouldn't know, you wouldn't know her

[Chorus]
Tell me something sweet about you
Say you won't lie (Say you won't lie)
Feel the city all around us, where we both hide
Don't wanna look up into those eyes
Since you'll only stay here this one night

[Post-Chorus]
Foreigner, hold me up
Met you in the night, lower east side
Owning up, told me it was your wedding night
We were both high

[Verse 2]
Woke up so late in the day, baby, I'm still faded (Met in SoHo)
Was I in a dream on your balcony dancing naked?
I pick my clothes up, I hope you had your phone off
You know how people talk excuses
Why you fucked her over?
That's foreign

[Chorus]
Tell me something sweet about you
Say you won't lie (Say you won't lie)
Feel the city all around us, where we both hide
Don't wanna look up into those eyes
Since you'll only stay here this one night

[Post-Chorus]
Foreigner, hold me up
Met you in the night, lower east side
Owning up, told me it was your wedding night
We were both high
We don't need explanations tonight
We don't no expectations tonight
