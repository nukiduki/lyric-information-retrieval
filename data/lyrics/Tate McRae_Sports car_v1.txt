[Verse 1]
Hey, cute jeans
Take mine off me
Oh, golly gee
I can't take no more
I'm goin' weak in my knees
Where'd you put those keys?
We can share one seat
We can share one seat

[Pre-Chorus]
In the alley, in the back
In the center of this room
With the windows rolled down
Boy, don't make me choose
In the alley, in the back
In the center of this room
With the windows rolled down
Boy, don't makе me choose

[Chorus]
I think you know what this is
I think you wanna uh
No, you ain't got no Mrs.​
Oh, but you got a sports car
We can uh-uh in it
Whilе you drive it real far
Yeah, you know what this is
Yeah, you know what this is

[Verse 2]
Pretty blue streetlights
And my hazel eyes
And if it feels right
We could go again like three, four times
So my type
Got butterflies
So good it hurts
Thinkin' 'bout what we did before this verse

[Pre-Chorus]
On the corner of my bed
Oh, and maybe on the beach
You could do it on your own
While you're lookin' at me

[Chorus]
I think you know what this is
I think you wanna uh (Do you?)
No, you ain't got no Mrs.​
Oh, but you got a sports car
We can uh-uh in it (We can uh)
While you drive it real far
Yeah, you know what this is
Yeah, you know what this is
I think you know what this is (Oh)
I think you wanna uh (You wanna)
No, you ain't got no Mrs.​
Oh, but you got a sports car
We can uh-uh in it (Uh-uh, uh-uh, mm)
While you drive it real far
Yeah, you know what this is
Yeah, you know what this is

[Bridge]
Oh my guy
You don't wanna waste my time (My time)
Let's go ride (Let's go)
Let's go ride (Come on)
Oh my guy
You don't wanna waste my time (You don't wanna waste my time)
Let's go ride
Let's go ride

[Outro]
I think you wanna, wanna (Oh)
But you got a sports car (Oh)
While you drive it real far
(Ah) Yeah, you know what this is
