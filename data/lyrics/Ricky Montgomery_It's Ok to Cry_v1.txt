[Chorus]
Something in your eyes
Come on out, don't hide
It's time to say goodbye
It's okay to cry
So cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry

[Verse 1]
Upset, heavy heart just sent my friend
To the darkness crawl into the next one
Crawl into the next one
I'm sick, feel it racing down my wrists
Feel it trap me down into the next one
Down into the next one

[Chorus]
Something in your eyes
Come over, don't hide
It's time to say goodbye
It's okay to cry
So cry, cry, cry (It's okay to cry)
Cry, cry, cry (Time to say goodbye)
Cry, cry, cry (It's okay to cry)
Cry, cry, cry (Time to say goodbye)

[Verse 2]
I'm spent, never said just what you meant
Never said I'll see you in the next one
Little players in the game
Little moments, you leave but they remain
But they remain (Remain, remain)

[Chorus]
Something in your eyes
Come on out, don't hide
It's time to say goodbye (Time to say goodbye)
It's okay to cry (It's okay to cry)
So cry, cry, cry (It's okay to cry)
Cry, cry, cry (Time to say goodbye)
Cry, cry, cry (It's okay to cry)
Cry, cry, cry (Time to say goodbye)

[Outro]
Cry, cry, cry (It's okay to cry)
Cry, cry, cry (It's okay to cry)
Cry, cry, cry (It's okay to cry)
Cry, cry, cry (It's okay to cry)
