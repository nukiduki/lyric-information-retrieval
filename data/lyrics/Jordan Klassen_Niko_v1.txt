[Verse 1]
The lies are lower than the faultlines
If you want to know the truth
You gotta dig into the gold mines
Where all the taller tales are proof

[Chorus]
So I’m like ‘Niko, Niko’
And she says ‘don’t go, don’t go’
We’re all like ‘Niko, Niko, don’t go down this dark road’
But Niko already knows

[Verse 2]
If you want to fill the ocean
With every story that you sail
Well it’s not deep enough to hold ‘em
It’s not deep enough to hold ‘em
Just a drop inside your pail

[Chorus]
So I’m like ‘Niko, Niko’
And she says ‘don’t go, don’t go’
We’re all like ‘Niko, Niko, don’t go down this dark road’

[Bridge]
Niko says the writing’s on the wall
And I
Wonder if the words are just too small for my eyes
So we’re like
We’re all like

[Chorus]
So I’m like ‘Niko, Niko’
And she says ‘don’t go, don’t go’
We’re all like ‘Niko, Niko, don’t go down this dark road’
