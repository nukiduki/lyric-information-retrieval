[Verse 1]
You made me who I am
I read the books, held mama's hand
You told me I wasn't worthy
But God always has a plan
They shaped and transformed me
Into someone they'd liked to see

[Pre-Chorus]
A quiet modest young lady
That's who I was meant to be

[Chorus]
I'm pure, I'm pure, I'm pure as a lamb
I'm heaven's little virgin, too holy for man
I'm glass, I'm fire, I don't know hate
And that's how I'll get to the pearly gate
I'm pure, I'm pure, I'm pure as a lamb
I pray every morning and as much as I can
A whispered blessing is all I can say
To keep the demons like you away

[Verse 2]
Now that I am beautiful
I wear what you want
You saved my soul
I have two ears for listening
And I'll keep doing what I'm told
And I hope you'll love me too
But I don't seem to be enough for you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm killing myself slowly
What else do you want me to do?

[Chorus]
I'm pure, I'm pure, I'm pure as a lamb
I'm heaven's little virgin, too holy for man
I'm glass, I'm fire, I don't know hate
And that's how I'll get to the pearly gate
I'm pure, I'm pure, I'm pure as a lamb
I pray every morning and as much as I can
A whispered blessing is all I can say
To keep the demons like you away

[Bridge]
You watered your garden and I grew
But you destroyed me
You grabbed me by the roots
You plucked my petals
Just like the Devil would do
And if I'm going to Hell, I hope that you go too

[Chorus]
I'm pure, I'm pure, I'm pure as a lamb
I'm heaven's little virgin, too holy for man
I'm glass, I'm fire, I don't know hate
And that's how I'll get to the pearly gate
[Outro]
Now I feel dirty
Look what you did
I wasn't an object, I was a kid
And I'm scarred, I'm mangled, I am used
And all of this because of you
