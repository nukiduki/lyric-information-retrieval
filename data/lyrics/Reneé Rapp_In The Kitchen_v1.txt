[Verse 1]
When I walk in the kitchen, my heart hits the floor
'Cause it's you that I'm missin'
I still see a vision of us cookin' dinner
And you holding me from behind (From behind)
And you say, "Please be careful, the knife is so big
And we can't have another ER trip
We're too young, too dumb
Too in love to afford it" (To afford it)

[Pre-Chorus]
And now it's just me
And a hundred square feet of bittersweet memories
Deleted the playlist, but I still hear all your favorite melodies
Strangers to lovers to enemies

[Chorus]
So I'll dance with your ghost in thе living room
And I'll play the piano alone
But I'm too scared to dеlete all our videos
'Cause it's real once everyone knows
Could've at least shown me some decency
Done me a favor and packed up your clothes
Fallin' in love, no, it ain't for the weak
So don't try this at home

[Verse 2]
The couch that we sat on back in New York
Has made its way, three thousand miles to LA
These pillows been talkin'
Askin' me where the hell you've been (Where the hell you've been)
Told me you loved me, two weeks in
And I knew I would fall for you over and over
But who would've known that
The fallin' would come to an end (Come to an end)

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it's just me
And a hundred square feet of bittersweet memories
Deleted the playlist, but I still hear all your favorite melodies
Strangers to lovers to enemies

[Chorus]
So I'll dance with your ghost in the living room
And I'll play the piano alone
But I'm too scared to delete all our videos
'Cause it's real once everyone knows
You could've at least shown me some decency
Done me a favor and packed up your clothes
Falling in love, no, it ain't for the weak
So don't try this at home

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
So don't try this at home
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
Ain't it funny how time shows you, you know nothing
'Cause I used to love you, but now you're dead to me
Strangers to lovers to enemies
