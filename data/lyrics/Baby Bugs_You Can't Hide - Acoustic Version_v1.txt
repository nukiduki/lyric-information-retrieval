[Verse 1]
You feel a breeze, but from nowhere
You hear a laugh, but nothing's there
I show up when you're unprepared
You know I like to see you scared

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be right behind you
No matter where you go
I'll be there to surprise you
And I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm the monster underneath your bed
I'm every thought inside your head
You can run, but you can't hide
No, not this, no, not this time
I'm the itching underneath your skin
Can't stop me from creeping in
You can run, but you can't hide
I am already inside

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

[Verse 2]
Deep down, you want me to stay
You'd get bored if I didn't play
That's rеally why you're so afraid
You want me watching night and day

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be right bеhind you
No matter where you go
I'll be there to surprise you
And I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm the monster underneath your bed
I'm every thought inside your head
You can run, but you can't hide
No, not this, no, not this time
I'm the itching underneath your skin
Can't stop me from creeping in
You can run, but you can't hide
I am already inside

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

[Verse 3]
I feel the tremble in your touch
I'll take it all, but it's not enough
I need to feel that twisted rush
And if you scream, I'll make you hush

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be right behind you
No matter where you go
I'll be there to surprise you
I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm the monster underneath your bed
I'm every thought inside your head
You can run, but you can't hide
No, not this, no, not this time
I'm the itching underneath your skin
Can't stop me from creeping in
You can run, but you can't hide
I am already inside

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

[Outro]
I am already inside
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
