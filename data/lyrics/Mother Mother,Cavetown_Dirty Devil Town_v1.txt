[Intro: Mother Mother]
Don't like livin’ in a dirty town
Don't like livin' in a dirty town
I don’t like livin' in a dirty town, 'cause a dirty town gets me down

[Verse 1: Mother Mother, Cavetown]
Life's alright in devil town(I saved up and I bought some land 'cause I can't stand livin' in a dirty town)
Yeah, right, no one's gonna catch us now(Yeah, I pinched my pennies and I put ’em down and I washed my hands of a dirty town)
Daddy’s bought a new car now(Plant my seeds in the ground
Yeah, I put 'em down in my new-found land)
We’re fine, no one's gonna catch us now('Cause you can't plant seeds in a dirty town no, you can’t plant seeds in a devil town)

[Chorus: Mother Mother, Cavetown]
Devil town is colder in the summertime
I'll lose my mind at least another thousand times
Hold my hand tight, we'll make it another night
I still gеt a little scared of something nеw
But I feel a little safer when I'm with you
Falling doesn't feel so bad when I know you've fallen this way too (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Verse 2: Mother Mother, Cavetown]
We're all dead in Devil town, that's fine, nothing's gonna scare us now (Ah, ah, ah, ah, all I need)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah all I need is a chicken wire and a chicken feed
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, all I see is a newfound land fertility!

[Chorus: Mother Mother, Cavetown]
Devil town is colder in the summertime
I'll lose my mind at least another thousand times
Hold my hand tight, we'll make it another night
I still get a little scared of something new
But I feel a little safer when I'm with you
Falling doesn't feel so bad when I know you've fallen this way too
(Too, too, too, too)

[Verse 3: Mother Mother]
I choppin' firewood, choppin' firewood
Chop-chop-chop
Just like a country boy should be choppin' wood
I country
My kindling sticks are the perfect little width
Kindling sticks

[Bridge: Mother Mother]
Don't like livin' in a dirty town (Hahaha)
Don't like livin' in a devil town
I don't like livin in a dirty town
'Cause a devil town gets me down

[Chorus: Mother Mother, Cavetown]
Devil town is colder in the summertime
I'll lose my mind at least another thousand times
Hold my hand tight, we'll make it another night (Ooh)
I still get a little scared of something new
But I feel a little safer when I'm with you
Falling doesn't feel so bad when I know you've fallen this way too-ooh
