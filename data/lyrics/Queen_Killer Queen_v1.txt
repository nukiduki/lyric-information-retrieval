[Verse 1]
She keeps MoÃ«t et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake", she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Khrushchev and Kennedy (Ooh, ooh)
At anytime, an invitation you can't decline (Ooh, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Caviar and cigarettes
Well-versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

[Chorus]
She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
(Pa-pa-pa-pa) Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Anytime) Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

[Verse 2]
To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah (Killer)
Then again incidentally (Killer)
If you're that way inclined (She's a killer queen)

[Pre-Chorus]
Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise
[Chorus]
She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
(Pa-pa-pa-pa) Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Anytime)

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Drop of a hat, she's as willing as
Playful as a pussycat
(Ooh) Then momentarily out of action
(Ooh) Temporarily out of gas (Ooh, da-da)
To absolutely drive (Drive you wild)
(Wild) She's out to get you
[Chorus]
She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
(Pa-pa-pa-pa) Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Anytime) Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

[Outro]
You wanna try?
