[Chorus]
I've been awake for three days
But I don't give a fuck
I ran away from myself
Tried to change but it sucked
I've been awake for three days
I'm a misfit at heart
No one remembers my name
But so what

[Verse 1]
Won't go to sleep today
Your words are poison
Say I'm a nobody
I'm a disappointment

[Pre-Chorus]
And my dreams are only ghosts inside my weary head
I am a superstar
No one seems to understand
Guess there is one thing you should know about

[Chorus]
I've been awake for three days
But I don't give a fuck
I ran away from myself
Tried to change but it sucked
I've been awake for three days
I'm a misfit at heart
No one remembers my name
But so what

[Verse 2]
Tell me to stay in line
Cos that's what you did
You think I'm wasting time
I think you're stupid

[Pre-Chorus]
Say my dreams get shattered heading for the hall of fame
I am a superstar
You don't seem to understand
Guess there is one thing you should know about

[Chorus]
I've been awake for three days
But I don't give a fuck
I ran away from myself
Tried to change but it sucked
I've been awake for three days
I'm a misfit at heart
No one remembers my name
But so what

[Bridge]
Been gone for the last three days
While everybody's running for a life they waste
Been gone for the last three days
While everybody's running for a life they waste
I'm so over it

[Chorus]
I've been awake for three days
But I don't give a fuck
I ran away from myself
Tried to change but it sucked
I've been awake for three days
I'm a misfit at heart
No one remembers my name
But so what
