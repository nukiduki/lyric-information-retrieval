[Intro]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-ah)

[Verse 1]
Pulled up in a trust-fund Mustang
25 minutes late, so fashionable
I’ve been lookin’ at an empty seat
In the same outfit from the date last week
He’s drunk and he snaps at the waiter
Haven’t eaten anything but I think I’m full
And I’m looking for the exit
Really wishing I never met him

[Chorus]
Are we better in pairs of two?
I’m alone in a crowded room
Aphrodite’s got a price
Got me fighting for my life
Left me here to die alone in a crowded room
And got my neck up to a knife
Aphrodite, help me survive you

[Verse 2]
She pulled up in her ex’s Lexus
Don’t know if she could talk about anything else
Said it’s been three days but you’re totally over it, emotionally available (Haha!)
Lucky, I got a things for stoners
Pretty face, just looking up, fill her bed
Maybe, it’ll get better
Still, I wish I never met her

[Chorus]
Are we better in pairs of two?
I’m alone in a crowded room
Aphrodite’s got a price
Got me fighting for my life
Left me here to die alone in a crowded room
And got my neck up to a knife
Aphrodite, help me survive you

[Bridge]
I’m not starting a fire
I’m starting a war
If love really is divine, I want to be reborn
There’s not enough wine in the world
Want wings on my feet, I could bust out the door
Have I been here before?

[Interlude]
Aphrodite’s got a price
Left me here to die alone
In a crowded room
Aphrodite, help me survive

[Chorus]
I’m alone in a crowded room
Aphrodite’s got a price
Got me fighting for my life
Left me here to die alone in a crowded room
And got my neck up to a knife
Aphrodite, help me survive you
