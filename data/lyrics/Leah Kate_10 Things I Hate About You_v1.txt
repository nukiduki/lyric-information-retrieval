[Verse 1]
I caught you cheating
You had the nerve to say you're sleepin', just not with her
But tell your friends that I'll be lost without you
And I'll admit it sometimes I miss when we were in it
So I made a list so I'll never forget all the things I hate about you

[Chorus]
Ten, you're selfish
Nine, you're jaded
Eight, the dumbest guy I've dated
Seven, talk a big game 'til you're naked
Only six seconds and I had to fake it
Five, you're toxic
Four, can't trust you
Three, you still got mommy issues
Two years of your bullshit I can't undo
One, I hate the fact that you made me love you

[Verse 2]
Your friends must suck if they think you're cool
A sloppy drunk obsessed with his Juul
Keep buying bottles with your daddy's money
And I don't know how I fell for your shit
You gross me out, now I've got the ick
And I've got a list of why you don't get to fuck me

[Chorus]
Ten, you're selfish
Nine, you're jaded
Eight, the dumbest guy I've dated
Seven, talk a big game 'til you're naked
Only six seconds and I had to fake it
Five, you're toxic
Four, can't trust you
Three, you still got mommy issues
Two years of your bullshit I can't undo
One, I hate the fact that you made me love you

[Bridge]
You made me love you
You made me love you
Ooh, oh, how'd you make me love you?
And I'll admit it, sometimes I miss when we were in it
So I made a list, yeah
Ten things I hate about you

[Chorus]
Ten, you're selfish
Nine, you're jaded
Eight, the dumbest guy I've dated
Seven, talk a big game 'til you're naked
Only six seconds and I had to fake it
Five, you're toxic
Four, can't trust you
Three, you still got mommy issues
Two years of your bullshit I can't undo
One, I hate the fact that you made me love you
