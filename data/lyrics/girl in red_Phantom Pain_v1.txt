[Chorus]
Why you gotta lead me on?
Your love is like a rose's thorn
I wish I never met you in the first place
My life would be much easier today
You're a con, you're an angel
You look so sweet, but you're not though
I never knew how good it could be
Until you swept me off my feet

[Verse]
I really didn't notice the heart on my sleeve
I think I got invested in you and me
A little too soon some might say
But who cares when it's fate?
You got me off quickly, but it was too late
I was already hooked with phantom pains
Nothing left for me to do
But lay around and think of you

[Chorus]
Why you gotta lead me on?
Your love is like a rose's thorn
I wish I never met you in the first place
My life would be much easier today
You're a con, you're an angel
You look so sweet, but you're not though
I never knew how good it could be
Until you swept me off my feet

[Bridge]
Mi amor, mi amor
Je t'aime, I adore every part of your face
I know this might be extreme
I truly believe we're meant to be

[Chorus]
Why you gotta lead me on?
Your love is like a rose's thorn
I wish I never met you in the first place
My life would be much easier today
You're a con, you're an angel
You look so sweet, but you're not though
I never knew how good it could be
Until you brought me to my knees

[Outro]
But let me love you, let me, let me, let me love you if you let me
Love me, if you let me, let me love you if you let me
I'll love you if you let me, I'll love you if you let me
I'll love you if you let me, I'll love you if you let me
I'll love you if you let me, I'll love you if you let me
Let me love you, I'll love you if you let me
Let me love you, I love you, love you, love you, love you
I love you
