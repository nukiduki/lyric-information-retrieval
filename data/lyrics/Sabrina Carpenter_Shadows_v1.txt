[Verse 1]
We all got nightmares in our dreams
We look for someone to believe in us
And show us the way, and make it okay
The world can be dangerous
There's something so rare in your veins
Not a single thing I would change
And oh, if you only knew how I see you
Would you come alive again, 'live again?

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I
I need you to understand

[Chorus]
I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they disappear in the light
I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they look a lot like mine
And listen to me, it's okay to be afraid
Just walk like you're never alone
I don't mind your shadows
Your shadows, baby, I don't

[Verse 2]
Pictures in our head
Of what we're supposed to be, measuring ourselves
But where is the love? Where is the love?
The world got us wonderin', wonderin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I
I need you to understand

[Chorus]
That I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they disappear in the light
And I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they look a lot like mine
And listen to me, it's okay to be afraid
Just walk like you're never alone
And I don't mind your shadows
Your shadows, baby, I don't

[Bridge]
And all these voices in our head
Well, they keep screamin' louder and louder
But they won't pull us under

[Chorus]
And baby, I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they disappear in the light
And I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they look a lot like mine
And listen to me, it's okay to be afraid
Just walk like you're never alone
And I don't mind your shadows
Your shadows, baby, I don't
