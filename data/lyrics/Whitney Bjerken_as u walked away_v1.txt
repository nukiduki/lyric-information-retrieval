[Verse 1]
Picture perfect like they are in the movies
You held the door
And we'd sit on a bench
And drink smoothies
Never a fight
Nor a single moment in vain
That's why I never expected
What you said to me on that day
In the rain

[Chorus]
My heart stops
The look in your eyes made my face drop
The weight of the world on my eyelids
How could you leave me like this
All alone now
A piece of my heart has been torn out
As you turn your back
Now there's nothing I could say
When you looked at me that way
I'm left to feel the pain
As you walked away

[Verse 2]
How long will it take for me to get over you
The feeling I felt is absent and filled in with blue
Now I'm pulling my hair out I can't sleep
My thoughts stay awake
Did I do something wrong
Was it my fault
What made you break
Too hard to take

[Chorus]
My heart stops
The look in your eyes
Made my face drop
The weight of the world
On my eyelids
How could you leave me like this
All alone now
A piece of my heart
Has been torn out
As you turn your back
Now there's nothing I could say
When you looked at me that way
I'm left to feel the pain
As you walked away

My heart stops
The look in your eyes made my face drop
The weight of the world on my eyelids
How could you leave me like this
