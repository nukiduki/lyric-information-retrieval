[Verse 1]
Are you gonna kiss me?
'Cause you're taking me home
It's four in the morning
Are we doing this wrong?
This weekend I saw you
Through eyes that are new
You got me falling for you
And I kinda want to

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what you mean
Is it all me?
Start to overthink everything
When you're close to me, I can't breathe
We're already six feet deep

[Chorus]
Let's fuck up the friendship
Come, get in my head
Baby, cut the tension
I'm hung by a thread
Maybe it's something
But let's not pretend
Or maybe it's nothing
And this is the end
We could never be (Oh, no)
We could never be friends
We could never be (Oh, no)
We could never be friends

[Verse 2]
It got kind of scary
My bones always knew
Oh, I didn't mean to
Are you feeling this too?

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what you mean
Is it all me?
Start to overthink everything
When you're close to me, I can't breathe
We're already six feet deep

[Chorus]
Let's fuck up the friendship
Come, get in my head
Baby, cut the tension
I'm hung by a thread
Maybe it's something
But let's not pretend
Or maybe it's nothing
And this is the end
We could never be (Oh, no)
We could never be friends
We could never be (Oh, no)
We could never be friends

[Bridge]
On the edge of my seat
I'll wait for the outcome
If we ever have one
Let me take the lead
You follow me closely
But come on and show me

[Chorus]
Let's fuck up the friendship
Come, get in my head
Baby, cut the tension
I'm hung by a thread
Maybe it's something
But let's not pretend
Or maybe it's nothing
And this is the end
We could never be (Oh, no)
We could never be friends
We could never be (Oh, no)
We could never be friends
