[Verse 1]
I got boulders on my shoulders
Collarbones begin to crack
There is very little left of me
And it's never coming back
There are certain things you ask of me
And there are certain things I lack
In the beginning, we were winning
But now I'm just making up facts

[Pre-Chorus]
What's it matter anymore?
If you believe the lies I tell
(What's it matter anymore?)
There's no meaning to the words
But we still sing these songs well
(What's it matter anymore?)
If we all left it alone
I'm sure it'd work itself out fine
(What's it matter, what's it matter, what's it matter anymore?)
We keep playing with the numbers
We are running out of time
We are running, we are running

[Chorus]
But you're a killer
And I'm your best friend
Think it's unfair, your situation
You say I'm changing
Sorry, I didn't know I had to stay the same
Could we talk about this later?
Your voice is driving me, driving me insane

[Verse 2]
Well, I try to write you poems, but the words, they don't make sense
My hand tries to grip the pencil, but the fingers are too tense
And I try to show emotion, but my eyes won't seem to wet
And I'd love to tell you stories, but I can't remember how they went
You're a flashlight in a dark room for the loneliest blackout
You were all we had left after it all was filtered out
Turn you on in a dark room right before we both pass out
Turn you on when I need you, but the batteries ran out
They ran out

[Chorus]
And you're a werewolf and I'm a full moon
And all your very worst enemies will be gone soon
I think you're changing
Don't worry, you don't gotta stay the same
Could we talk about this later?
Your voice is driving me, driving me insane
[Outro]
Driving me insane
Driving me insane
Driving me insane
Oh, it's driving me insane
Driving me insane
Driving me insane
Driving me insane, oh
Driving me insane
