[Verse 1]
Self-assured, she strikes a pose, a deadly silhouette
Sits behind a cloud of smoke and lights a cigarette
A smoky cabaret with nights of sins and no regret
Lights go down, spotlight, now cue the quartet

[Verse 2]
I look around the room, sterilize the nagging noose
Elegantly dressed, human trash in baby blue
We're taken to the floor and dancing to the lovely tunes
Tip your top hats, raise your glass, 'cause here's to you

[Chorus]
Poor me, poor you, we can't afford the life wе choose
Big dreams, small shoes, got nothing еlse left to lose
Same me, same you, until the drugs start doing you
Poor me, poor you, the dark side of the silver spoon

[Verse 3]
The men in suits gather 'round a secret rendezvous
Taking off their rings, their finger sings a different tune
A velvet curtain hide the sound of guilt in secret rooms
Unfaithful night, housewife, she can smell the perfume

[Chorus]
Poor me, poor you, we can't afford the life we choose
Big dreams, small shoes, got nothing else left to lose
Same me, same you, until the drugs start doing you
Poor me, poor you, the dark side of the silver spoon

[Bridge]
Ooh, all of my suits, are ripped up and used
They'll never fit the same way again
Ooh, all the lawsuits, they take all my loot
They'll never get it back again, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me the truth, when did the drugs start doing you?
You, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Poor me, poor you, and maybe one more drink or two
Big dreams, small shoes, got nothing else left to lose
Same me, same you, until the drugs start doing you
Poor me, poor you, the dark side of the silver spoon

[Outro]
The dark side of the silver spoon
