[Verse 1]
I think back to when
Life was good, I was content
But it's been so many years
I can't remember how it feels

[Chorus]
I reach for me but I'm not there
It's so lonely but who cares
It's fine, it's okay
I'll die anyway
I reach for me but I'm not there
I always wonder why I'm here
It's fine, it's okay
I'll die anyway

[Verse 2]
I guess I could say
I've learned to live this way
But it's still hard to find
Reasons to stay alive

[Bridge]
Accepting I'm pointless
Isn't the hardest
When it's so
Completely obvious
My questions are countless
Looking for answers
So far I'm clueless
Go back to sleep

[Chorus]
I reach for me but I'm not there
It's so lonely but who cares
It's fine, it's okay
I'll die anyway
I reach for me but I'm not there
I always wonder why I'm here
It's fine, it's okay
I'll die anyway

[Outro]
I'll die anyway
I'll die anyway
I'll die anyway
I'll die anyway
