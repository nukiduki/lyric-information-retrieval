[Verse 1: Jeff Lewis, Choir, All]
Did I mention that I'm in love with you?
And did I mention there's nothin' I can do?
And did I happen to say I dream of you every day?
Well, let me shout it out loud
If that's okay, hey, hey (Hey)
If that's okay (Hey)

[Pre-Chorus: Jeff Lewis]
I met this girl who rocked my world like it's never been rocked
And now I'm livin' just for her and I won't ever stop
I never thought that it could happen to a guy like me
But now look at what you've done
You got me down on my knees

[Chorus: Jeff Lewis, Choir, All]
Because my love for you is ridiculous
I never knew (Who knew?)
That it could be like this
My love for you is ridiculous
My love is R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S (R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S)
It's (Ridiculous), just (Ridiculous)
And I would give my kingdom for just one kiss

[Verse 2: Jeff Lewis, Choir, All]
Well, did I mention that I'm in love with you?
And did I mention there's nothin' I can do?
And did I happen to say I dream of you every day?
Well, let me shout it out loud
If that's okay-ay-ay, yay (Hey)
If that's okay (Hey)

[Pre-Chorus: Jeff Lewis]
I gotta know which way to go, come on, give me a sign
You're gonna show me that you're only ever gonna be mine
Don't wanna go another minute livin' without you
'Cause if your heart just isn't in it, I don't know what I'll do

[Chorus: Jeff Lewis, Choir, All]
Because my love for you is ridiculous
I never knew (Who knew?)
That it could be like this
My love for you is ridiculous
My love is R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S (R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S)
It's (Ridiculous), just (Ridiculous)
And I would give my kingdom for just one kiss
Come on now

[Breakdown: Jeff Lewis & Choir]
Huh, oh yeah
Huh, yeow
Alright (Hey)
Alright (Hey)

[Chorus: Jeff Lewis, Choir, All]
Because my love for you is ridiculous
I never knew (Who knew?)
That it could be like this
My love for you is ridiculous
My love is R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S (R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S)
It's (Ridiculous), just (Ridiculous)
And I would give my kingdom for just one kiss
Come on now
