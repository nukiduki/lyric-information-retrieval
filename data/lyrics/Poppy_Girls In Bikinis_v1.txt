[Verse 1]
They say take it off, I say keep it on
Bandeau, crop top, boy short, red thong
I see you in my dreams, slow-motion movie scenes
Homemade, crochet, dreamy with a low waist
Cheeky, tankini

[Chorus]
Girls in bikinis
Girls in bikinis on roller skates, in outer space
I see girls in bikinis
Girls in bikinis in platform heels, in new hot wheels
Girls in bikinis
Girls in bikinis, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Nylon, spandex, dear Lord, what's next?
Polyester, pinstripe, whet my appetite
Polka dots, see-through, put me in a good mood
A-cup, D-cup, give me love, don't cover up
Slow down my Lamborghini for

[Chorus]
Girls in bikinis
Girls in bikinis on roller skates, in outer space
I see girls in bikinis
Girls in bikinis in platform heels, in new hot wheels
Girls in bikinis
Girls in bikinis, ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
I wanna see boys in bikinis too
They'd look good on you

[Chorus]
Girls in bikinis
Girls in bikinis on roller skates, in outer space
I see girls in bikinis
Girls in bikinis in platform heels, in new hot wheels
Girls in bikinis
Girls in bikinis, ooh-ooh
