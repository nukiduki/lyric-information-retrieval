Sometimes
Love will break until you burst

And sometimes
You've just gotta come to terms with the fact
That someone might not love you
The same way that you love them

Sometimes
Everyday feels like the worst

And sometimes
You've got to say "This fucking hurts"

'Cause someone out there might not make you feel as bad

And this sucks and I feel it coming for me
I'd like to quit all this pretending
But everytime I feel the pen in my hands
You go and write another ending
Why do you tell me that you listen to my music
When you know that it's about you?
Oh my god
I'm gonna lose it

I'm broken but I'm proud
I'm not feeling okay
And I've spoken so loud
So loud

You had to hear me say
"I want you so bad but I'm still so close to giving up
And everything we had just feel like it was not enough."

And I really thought you wanted this
Why can't you accept the more you push away the sooner there'll be nothing left

But I'll keep standing still
Just waiting here for you

'Cause sometimes when your heart is broken that's all you know how to do

Sometimes
There's not enough to go around

And sometimes
You end up lost before you're found

'Cause sometimes people leave you and
You don't know how to leave them

Sometimes you have to learn to make mistakes
And sometimes you have to give more than you take

'Cause someday
Someone will show you the love that you deserve

And maybe you've moved on
I try not to think about it

My friends they always tell me
I'll get better soon but I doubt it

Why do we run in circles?
Why do you put me through this?
Why don't you love me?

Oh my god
I can't do this

I'm broken but I'm proud
I'm not feeling okay
And I've spoken so loud
So loud
You had to hear me say

"I want you so bad
But I'm still so close to giving up
And everything we had just feel like it was not enough"

And I really thought you wanted this
Why can't you accept the more you push away the sooner there'll be nothing left?
But I'll keep standing still
Just waiiting here for you

'Cause sometimes when your heart is broken that's all you know how to do

Sometimes
You feel love and you feel loss

And sometimes you pick up where you left off
And someday I'll be happy
And I hope that you will be too

Sometimes things are better off this way
And sometimes you turn to leave cause you can't stay

And when I turn to go, I won't look back at you
'Cause sometimes when your heart is broken that's just what you have to do
