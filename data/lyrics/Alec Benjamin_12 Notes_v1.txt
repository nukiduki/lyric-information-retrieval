[Verse 1]
Read an article about particles while sitting at the bar
How several dozen elements from several dozen stars
Made several combinations and that made us who we are
What starts out small and simple may become a work of art
So, baby, I went home to play these notes on my guitar
I sat down at the keys and tried to speak straight from my heart
Started small and simple, tried to make a work of art for you

[Chorus]
And after having sat there with my eyes closеd
All night at my piano
I've come to find that twelvе notes
Twelve is not enough to tell you
Just how much I love you, baby
Twelve is not enough for you
Now I know
No matter how far I go
I've come to find that twelve notes
Twelve is not enough to tell you
Just how much I love you, baby
Twelve is not enough for you
Twelve is not enough, no, baby
Twelve is not enough for you

[Verse 2]
I wrote an article that particles are not the centerpiece
That the center of my universe is you and now I see
That's why it's been so hard for me to write a melody
Why everything I sing for you just never feels complete
It never feels complete

[Chorus]
And after having sat there with my eyes closed
All night at my piano
I've come to find that twelve notes
Twelve is not enough to tell you
Just how much I love you, baby
Twelve is not enough for you
Now I know
No matter how far I go
I've come to find that twelve notes
Twelve is not enough to tell you
Just how much I love you, baby
Twelve is not enough for you
Twelve is not enough, no, baby
Twelve is not enough for you

[Bridge]
And I swear I'd do it
If it could be done
But you're more than music
You're the only one

[Chorus]
After having sat there with my eyes closed
All night at my piano
I've come to find that twelve notes
Twelve is not enough to tell you
Just how much I love you, baby
Twelve is not enough for you
Now I know
No matter how far I go
I've come to find that twelve notes
Twelve is not enough to tell you
Just how much I love you, baby
Twelve is not enough for you
Twelve is not enough, no, baby
Twelve is not enough for you
