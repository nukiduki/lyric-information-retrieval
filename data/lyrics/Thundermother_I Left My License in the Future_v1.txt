[Verse 1]
I was born to be a racer
But I never had the time
Caught up in many reasons
Been busy staying alive

[Refrain]
How did I end up in a white Chevrolet?
Don't even know if it's the gas or the break
I got my backseat moments in the back of my mind
But this stick is of a different kind

[Pre-Chorus]
He's pulling me over I'm speeding away
I guess I'm serving time

[Chorus]
I left my license in the future (Ooh)
Think I forgot it in a bar (Ooh)
I got a hazy dazy memory
I think I never ever got it at all
I left my license in the future
Didn't even know I had a car
'Cuz I'm a crazy lazy city girl
I think I never ever got it at all
I left my license in the future

[Verse 2]
I was waiting for the moment
But the moment was a lie
So truth be told if you wanna know
I never had the drive to drive

[Refrain]
But here I am and I'm a highway star
And now I'm in a black jaguar
I'm speeding up don't wanna go into a prison cell
In fact I'd rather go to hell

[Pre-Chorus]
I drive to a future of fortune and fame
I ain't serving time

[Chorus]
I left my license in the future (Ooh)
Think I forgot it in a bar (Ooh)
I got a hazy dazy memory
I think I never ever got it at all
I left my license in the future (Ooh)
Didn't even know I had a car (Ooh)
'Cuz I'm a crazy lazy city girl
I think I never ever got it at all

[Bridge]
I never knew it would be such a ball
The only drag I know is from Ru-Paul

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I left my license in the future
Think I forgot it in a bar (Ooh)
I got a hazy dazy memory
I think I never ever got it at all
I left my license in the future (Ooh)
Didn't even know I had a car (Ooh)
'Cuz I'm a crazy lazy city girl
I think I never ever got it at all

[Outro]
The road is on fire
My engine’s aflame
I guess you’re serving time
I left my license in the future
