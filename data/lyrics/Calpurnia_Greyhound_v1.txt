[Verse 1]
Going to Seattle on the Greyhound
I missed school for this
Bought two tickets last September
Before your harmful bliss
Playin' at the Neptune
They were your favourite
I still can't believe you're gone
Can't get you to explain it

[Verse 2]
I wish I could go home, forget this ever happened
I feel depressed, out of whack, and in my own world
Sometimes I can't feel a thing
I can barely feel a thing, ah-ah

[Chorus]
Hats off to you
For you to go
Wish you were here
At the show

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Hats off to you
For you to go
Wish you were here
But now it blows

[Verse 3]
It ruled your world
You lost the battle
It broke my heart in half
When I heard the bottles rattle
I know you wanted to be here
But now you're gone
I'll be thinking of you
When the lights come on, ah-ah

[Chorus]
Hats off to you
For you to go
Wish you were here
But now it blows
