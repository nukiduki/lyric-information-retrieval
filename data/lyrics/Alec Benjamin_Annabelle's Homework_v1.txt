[Verse 1]
Careful as I write her name
On the corner of the page
Make it look like it was her, all along
And I put the paper in my bag
As I'm walking back to class
And the notes I wrote
That took me so long

[Pre-Chorus]
She doesn't notice me
She just smiles and says
"Thank you for the trigonometry"
'Cause that's all it meant to her

[Chorus]
But I spent
22 days and 21 nights
Crossing every T, just making it right
Only to discover it's not worth
Doing Annabelle's homework
Doesn't matter how many papers I write
End of the equation won't be you and I
And now I'm just another who got hurt
Doing Annabelle's homework
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Doing Annabelle's homework

[Verse 2]
Careful as I walk away
So she can't see it on my face
How I look and now I'm feeling so bad
I'm disappointed in myself
'Cause I know love's not for sale
Oh, my mother raised me better than that

[Pre-Chorus]
She doesn't notice me
She just smiles and says
"Thank you for the geography"
'Cause that's all it meant to her

[Chorus]
But I spent
22 days and 21 nights
Crossing every T, Just making it right
Only to discover it's not worth
Doing Annabelle's homework
Doesn't matter how many papers I write
End of the equation won't be you and I
And now I'm just another who got hurt
Doing Annabelle's homework
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Doing Annabelle's homework

[Bridge]
I'm alive, you don't know I'm here
Just circling around in your atmosphere, yeah
I'm alive, you don't know I'm here
Just circling around, just circling

[Chorus]
22 days and 21 nights
Crossing every T, just making it right
Only to discover it's not worth
Doing Annabelle's homework
Doesn't matter how many papers I write
End of the equation won't be you and I
And now I'm just another who got hurt
Doing Annabelle's homework
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And now I'm just another who got hurt
Doing Annabelle's homework
