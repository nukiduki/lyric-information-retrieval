[Verse 1]
I said you look pretty
All strung out on coke
You said it's not funny
But it wasn't a joke
And you won't remember
But I carried you home
You sat in the shower
While I washed off your clothes

[Chorus]
But isn't that what friends are for
Even if we used to be more?
Like lovers or partners in crime
And you were still mine

[Verse 2]
You said we should get out
While we still could
And I shoulda listened
But I misunderstood
Thought you wanted me tied down
I started to chafe
But it's easy to see now
You just wanted me safe

[Chorus]
And when the cops broke down our door
And held us both against our floor
Did we look like lovers or partners in crime?
Did you look like mine?
Or did we look like fools
Tryna get away with it all?
Thinkin' we'd be saved by a call
From each other
We were on the same boat

[Verse 3]
Didn't see you for ages
Didn't pick up your phone
Made it out of our cages
Never made it back home
I was late to the party
Of an old family friend
I was lookin' for parkin'
Thought I saw you again

[Chorus]
Someone I've seen before
You couldn't look any more
Like a lover or a partner in crime
Or something of mine

[Outro]
I said you look pretty
All strung out on coke
You said it's not funny
But it wasn't a joke
