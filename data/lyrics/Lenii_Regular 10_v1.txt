[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning under thick clouds
Pinning me down
I'm wearing sweats under a ball gown
Had a dream again
That my twelve year old self is dissapointed in me
But generally

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm doing well can you tell
I'm a regular ten
Met some strangers
And called them my friends
But I know I'm not the only pretender
Lying under pressure
Saying I got my shit together

[Chorus]
Oh I bet that you've got bodies in your closet
Skeletons in your belongings
I've got money on it
Everybody's got a bunch of shit they wanna hide
Show me yours and then I'll show you mine

Oh I bet that you've got bodies in your closet
Skeletons in your belongings
I've got money on it
Maybe there's a half eaten banana and that's fine
Show me yours and I'll show you mine

[Verse 2]
I drink seven coffees on a good day
Need a good shake
To wake me up cause I stay out late
My mom just called to ask me when I last ate
Well, I had a reece's peanut butter cup on monday

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm doing well can you tell
I'm a regular ten
Met some strangers
And called them my friends
But I know we're only playing pretend
Can't take the pressure get my shit together

[Chorus]
Oh I bet that you've got bodies in your closet
Skeletons in your belongings
I've got money on it
Everybody's got a bunch of shit they wanna hide
Show me yours and then I'll show you mine

Oh I bet that you've got bodies in your closet
Skeletons in your belongings
I've got money on it
Maybe there's a half eaten banana and that's fine
Show me yours and I'll show you mine

[Bridge]
Tryna be, somebody, you might like
Is an awful lotta thought put into
Such a waste of time
Tryna be, somebody, that I like
Is a struggle I might cover
But it's always on my mind

I woke up this morning under thick clouds
Pinning me down

[Chorus]
Oh I bet that you've got bodies in your closet
Skeletons in your belongings
I've got money on it
Everybody's got a bunch of shit they wanna hide
Show me yours and then I'll show you mine

Oh I bet that you've got bodies in your closet
Skeletons in your belongings
I've got money on it
Maybe there's a half eaten banana and that's fine
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
