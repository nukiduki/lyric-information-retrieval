[Intro]
De-de-de-depression
Teenage suicidal
Why girls?
Emotional
Social anxiety

[Verse 1]
Pretty face with pretty bad dreams
No one knows I cry in my sleep
Waking up feeling like shit
It's a normal thing to feel like this

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't care, I'm feeling down
I wanna stay home, never go outside
Summer depression comes every year
I just want to disappear (Depression)

[Chorus]
Summer depression
There's so much time to question my life
Summer depression
It's my
Summer depression

[Verse 2]
My worst habit
Is my own sadness
So I stay up all night, wondering why
I'm so tired all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
All my friends are doing things
It's good for them, but I'm nothing
Summer depression comes every year
I just want to disappear (Depression)

[Chorus]
Summer depression (Why?)
There's so much time to question my life
Summer depression
It's my
Summer depression

[Interlude]
Teenage suicidal
Why girls?
Emotional
Social anxiety
Depression

[Chorus]
Summer depression
There's so much time to question my life
Summer depression
It's my
Summer depression

[Outro]
(Depression)
