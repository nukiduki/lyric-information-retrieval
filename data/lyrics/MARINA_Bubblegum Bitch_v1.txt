[Intro]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Got a figure like a pin-up, got a figure like a doll
Don't care if you think I'm dumb, I don't care at all
Candy bear, sweetie pie, wanna be adored
I'm the girl you'd die for

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll chew you up and I'll spit you out
'Cause that's what young love is all about
So pull me closer and kiss me hard
I'm gonna pop your bubblegum heart

[Chorus]
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips
Hit me with your sweet love, steal me with a kiss
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch

[Interlude]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Queentex, latex, I'm your wonder maid
Life gave me some lemons so I made some lemonade
Soda pop, soda pop, baby, here I come
Straight to number one

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, dear diary, I met a boy
He made my doll heart light up with joy
Oh, dear diary, we fell apart
Welcome to the life of Electra Heart

[Chorus]
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips
Hit me with your sweet love, steal me with a kiss
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch

[Bridge]
I think I want your, your American tan
Oh, oh, oh
I think you're gonna be my biggest fan
Oh, oh, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips
Hit me with your sweet love, steal me with a kiss
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips
Hit me with your sweet love, steal me with a kiss
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch
