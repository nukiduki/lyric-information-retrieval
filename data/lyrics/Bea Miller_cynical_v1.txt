[Verse 1]
Lie to me, but don't you cry for me
I finally see through your pretending
Honestly, your honesty means nothing to me
Coming from your mouth, out of your mouth
You should beg me to believe
That what you say is really what you mean
What do you mean, mean?

[Chorus]
I tried to love you, hopeless baby
But I'm too cynical
Was so convinced I wasn't faking
'Cause I'm irrational
Oh, and I'm honestly fine
You've proven me right and I might kinda like it
'Cause if I saw it coming
Maybe I'm not so cynical (Ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
You can think that I'm a bitch
But I don't switch between it just for sympathy
'Cause misery loves company
But I don't need it

[Chorus]
I tried to love you, hopeless baby
But I'm too cynical
Was so convinced I wasn't faking
'Cause I'm irrational
Oh, and I'm honеstly fine
You've proven mе right and I might kinda like it
'Cause if I saw it coming
Maybe I'm not so cynical (Ooh-ooh)

[Bridge]
'Cause everytime I give love a try
I never like what I find
'Cause everytime I give love a try
I never like what I find
'Cause everytime I give love a try
I never like what I find
'Cause everytime I give love a try
I never like what I find

[Chorus]
I tried to love you, hopeless baby
But I'm too cynical
Was so convinced I wasn't faking
'Cause I'm irrational
Oh, and I'm honestly fine
You've proven me right and I might kinda like it
'Cause if I saw it coming
Maybe I'm not so cynical (Ooh-ooh)
