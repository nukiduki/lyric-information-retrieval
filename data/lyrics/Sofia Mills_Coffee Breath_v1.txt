Ba ba dum, ba ba dumbadumba, da ba bum, ba ba dum

Woke up in your new apartment
In your twin-size bed
Coffee starting
Don't remember much
All I know is that you talk too much
Time to go

Ba ba dum, ba ba dumbadumba, da ba bum, ba ba dum

You've got those big blue eyes
Drive me crazy
Make me fantasize 'bout you baby
And you smell so sweet
Like fresh-picked daisies
Call me Dahmer 'cuz your hearts so tasty

Ba ba dum, ba ba dumbadumba, da ba bum, ba ba dum

And I watched you break
Like glass, you shatter
Said it's my mistake, I make things harder
So I tried my best
To shut my mouth
But all the thoughts I hid dug their way out

Ba ba dum, ba ba dumbadumba, da ba bum, ba ba dum

Said you can't trust me
I said it's fine
Because I'm not happy till I tell a lie
Now my bedsheets smell
Like your cologne
And in our separate worlds we sleep alone

Ba ba dum, ba ba dumbadumba, da ba bum, ba ba dum x2
