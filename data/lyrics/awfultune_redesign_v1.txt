Rain rain go away
Come again another day
I wanna live forever
But mental illness gets in the way
I feel so compelled
When mania helps itself
I cut my bangs and dye my hair
I do it so well
Look how beautiful it is
I am not in charge of this
And when i come down
I know that i’ll be pissed
Theres something inside
That fucking hurts me every time
Ive tried every single
Pill to help me chill
And i’m not satisfied
One minute i’ll be fucked
And the next minute i’m fine
I can’t believe myself
Im overwhelmed
I think ive lost my mind
Don’t romanticize my life
I need a redesign
Don’t romanticize my life
I, i need a redesign

I have the good days
Good phase
Feeling like i like my face
And body, taking pictures
Cuz i know im a hottie
Then the bad days, comes in waves
Feelin like i gained weight
Wish i could disembody
And be somebody else
Cause im unwell
I can't control myself
Im asking for help

Theres something inside
That fucking hurts me every time
Ive tried every single
Pill to help me chill
And i’m not satisfied
One minute i’ll be fucked
And the next minute i’m fine
I can’t believe myself
Im overwhelmed
I think ive lost my mind
Don’t romanticize my life
I need a redesign
Don’t romanticize my life
I, i need a redesign
