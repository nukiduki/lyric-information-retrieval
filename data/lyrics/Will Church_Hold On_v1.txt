[Intro]
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I run away like a renegade
Running fast, but I can't escape
Cut my heart with the sharpest blade (Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm back again, and I'm falling down
Still I pray I'll be safe and sound
I am lost, or will I be found?

[Pre-Chorus]
And it goes over my, over my, over my, over my head
Life is flashing by, but you keep me alive

[Chorus]
Show me how to hold on
Show me how to find my way home
Show me how to find my way home
Show me how to hold on
Show me how to find my way home
Show me how to find my way home
Show me how to fight

[Verse 2]
I live my life on the battlefield
Many times that I try to heal
I got scars, I'm not made of steel
Thesе broken walls, they're surrounding mе
And when they fall, I'm stuck underneath
Hear my call, are you listening?

[Pre-Chorus]
And it goes over my, over my, over my, over my head
Way too fast to know what I'm hiding from

[Chorus]
Show me how to hold on
Show me how to find my way home
Show me how to find my way home
Show me how to hold on
Show me how to find my way home
Show me how to find my way home
Show me how to fight

[Outro]
(Show me how to, show me how to)
Show me how to find my way home (Show me how to)
Show me how to fight
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
