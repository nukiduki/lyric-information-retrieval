[Intro]
I'm on a new level, something's got me feeling like
I could be inflammable, and I might be
I'm gonna light it up, nothing's gonna stop me
If I say this is what I want, yeah

[Verse 1]
Got the Japanese denim and loafers on my feet
Looking like a rock star from the S-S-Seventies
I had a premonition, and here's what I'll say
I got a big fat, "What? Get outta my way"

[Chorus]
I'm on a new level, something's got me feeling like
I could be inflammable, and I might be
I'm gonna light it up, nothing's gonna stop me
If I say this is what I want

[Verse 2]
Got my Ray-Bans on and I'm rolling with the boys
Having all this swagger was never a choice
My big fat ego is making me say
"This '99 Vintage has impeccable taste"

[Chorus]
I'm on a new level, something's got me feeling like
I could be inflammable, and I might be
I'm gonna light it up, nothing's gonna stop me
If I say this is what I want, yeah

[Bridge]
I'm loving this new self-esteem
Like the one I had at seventeen
So unfazed by the world and it screams
And it screams and I scream

[Refrain]
I'm doing it again, doing it again, baby
Doing it again, doing it again, baby
I'm doing it again, doing it again, baby
Doing it again, doing it again
I'm doing it again, doing it again, baby
Doing it again, doing it again, baby
I'm doing it again, doing it again, baby
Doing it again, doing it again

[Chorus]
I'm on a new level, something's got me feeling so good
(I could be inflammable, and I might be)
My energy is through the roof
(I'm gonna light it up)
Yeah, nothing's gonna stop me now
(If I say this is what I want)

[Outro]
I'm doing it again, doing it again, baby
Doing it again, doing it again, baby
I'm doing it again, doing it again, baby
Doing it again, doing it again
I'm doing it again, doing it again, baby
Doing it again, doing it again, baby
I'm doing it again, doing it again, baby
Doing it again, doing it again, baby
