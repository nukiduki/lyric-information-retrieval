[Verse 1]
Run me in circles like you always do
Mess with me on purpose, so I'll hang on to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know what you mean when you act like that
But you don't know it's breaking my heart
Said that it was just never gonna happen
Then almost kissed me in the dark
Every time we talk, it just hurts so bad
'Cause I don't even know what we are
I don't even know where to start
But I can play the part

[Chorus]
We say we're friends, but I'm catching you across the room
It makes no sense 'cause we're fighting over what we do
And there's no way that I'll end up being with you
But friends don't look at friends that way
Friends don't look at friends that way

[Verse 2]
Can't even tell if I love or hate you more
You've got me addicted and I can't tell who's keeping score

[Pre-Chorus]
I know what you mean when you act like that
But you don't know it's breaking my heart
Said that it was just never gonna happen
Then almost kissed me in the dark
Every time we talk, it just hurts so bad
'Cause I don't even know what we are
I don't even know where to start
But I can play the part

[Chorus]
We say we're friends, but I'm catching you across the room
It makes no sense 'cause we're fighting over what we do
And there's no way that I'll end up being with you
But friends don't look at friends that way

[Refrain]
Friends don't look at friends that way
Friends don't look at friends that way
Friends don't look at friends that way
Mm, hey

[Chorus]
We say we're friends, but I'm catching you across the room
It makes no sense 'cause we're fighting over what we do
And there's no way that I'll end up being with you
But friends don't look at friends that way
Friends don't look at friends that way
