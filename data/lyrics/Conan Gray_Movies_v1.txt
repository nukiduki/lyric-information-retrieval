[Intro]
Movies, movies
I want a love like the movies

[Verse 1]
I look at you like you're perfect for me
If you are the diamond, then I am the ring
All of our friends think of us jealously
We’re so sweet, so sweet
Built us a world and I gave you the key
Still can't believe that this isn't a dream
Falling in love with a damn fantasy
That’s so me, so me

[Pre-Chorus]
But I've been livin'
Life in fiction

[Chorus]
In my head, we're dancing in the dark
In my head, we kiss under the stars
But we know that's not what we're doing
'Causе, baby, this ain't like the movies

[Post-Chorus]
Moviеs, movies
I want a love like the movies

[Verse 2]
We go to parties with people you know
We’re holding hands, but it’s all just for show
'Cause Monday through Friday, we both barely spoke
They don’t know, they can't know
That just on the drive here, I was looking through your texts
I was screaming my damn head off, "how you still love your ex?"
And you say that it's over, but why does she call you
At 3AM and 4AM?
That's a funny way of staying friends

[Chorus]
In my head, we’re dancing in the dark
In my head, we kiss under the stars
But we know that's not what we're doing
'Cause, baby, this ain't like the movies
In my head, we never grow apart
In my head, you never break my heart
But we know that's not what we're doing
'Cause, baby, this ain't like the movies

[Post-Chorus]
Movies, movies
I want a love like the movies
Movies, movies
I want a love like the movies

[Bridge]
Baby, we lost all the love that we had (Movies, movies)
And I can't pretend it'll ever come back (I want a love like the movies)
And I think you're seeing right through me (Movies, movies)
That, baby, this ain't like the movies

[Outro]
And I want a love like the movies
