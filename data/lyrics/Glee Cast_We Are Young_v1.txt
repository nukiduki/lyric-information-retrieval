[RACHEL]
Give me a second, I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, he is waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar, and...

[FINN]
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things, the holes in my apologies
You know, I'm trying hard to take it back

[SAM & QUINN]
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home...

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

[THE TROUBLETONES]
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

[SANTANA & BRITTANY]
Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart

[RACHEL]
But our friends are back
So let's raise a cup
Cause I found someone to carry me home

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

[MERCEDES]
Whoa!

[THE TROUBLETONES]
Tonight, we are young (We are young)
So let's set the world on fire (Fire)
We can burn brighter (Brighter)
Than the sun

[QUINN]
Carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na na na)
Just carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na na na)
Carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na na na)
Just carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na na na)

[FINN]
The moon is on my side (Carry me home tonight)
I have no reason to run (Just carry me home tonight)
So will someone come and carry me home tonight?

[SANTANA]
The angels never arrived (Na na na na na na na na)
But I can hear the choir (Just carry me home tonight)
So will someone come and carry me home...?

[RACHEL & FINN]
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

[MERCEDES]
We are young, yeah

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Tonight, we are young (We are young)
So let's set the world on fire (Fire)
We can burn brighter (Brighter)
Than the sun

[RACHEL & FINN]
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home tonight
