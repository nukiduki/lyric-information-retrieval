[Verse 1]
I remember you couldn't stop crying
You found me when I thought I was dying
Believe me when I say
I tried so hard to change
All the crazy shit I made you do
The long nights you held me through
Believe me when I say
I could never be saved
Be saved

[Chorus]
Yeah, I tried
To get it off my mind
To leave it all behind
Don't wanna make it worse
I'm gonna make it work
Yeah, I tried
To get it off my mind
To leave it all bеhind
Don't wanna make it worse
I'm gonna make it work

[Verse 2]
I rеmember you stayed up all night
To make sure I was alright
Believe me when I say
I would have done the same
I hate the way my brain is wired
Can't trust my mind, it's such a liar
Believe me when I say
I can't carry the weight
The weight

[Chorus]
Yeah, I tried
To get it off my mind
To leave it all behind
Don't wanna make it worse
I'm gonna make it work
Yeah, I tried
To get it off my mind
To leave it all behind
Don't wanna make it worse
I'm gonna make it work

[Bridge]
Oh, I will make it work, I'll make it work
I'll make it work
Oh, I will make it work, I'll make it work
I'll make it work
Oh, I brush off the dirt, get off the curb
I'll do the work, oh, I
I'm so disturbed, can't fix the hurt
Can't fix the hurt

[Chorus]
Yeah, I tried
To get it off my mind
To leave it all behind
Don't wanna make it worse
I'm gonna make it work

[Outro]
Yeah, I tried
Yeah, I tried
Yeah, I tried
Yeah, I tried
