[Verse 1]
Who needs a coffee? 'Cause I'm doing a run
I'm writing down the orders now for everyone
The coffee is free, just like me
I'm an unpaid intern

[Verse 2]
Sorting papers, running around (Runnin' around)
Sitting in the meeting room, not making a sound (Not a sound)
Barely people, somehow legal
Unpaid intern

[Verse 3]
You work all day, go back to your dorm
And since you can't afford a mortgage, you just torrent a porn
'Cause you're an intern (Unpaid)

[Outro]
