[Verse 1]
She's got something about her
It's easy when you're around her
Big smile and dark eyes you get lost in
She's the first on the dance floor
Watch her laugh, the kind you would fall for
She'll always be there when you're calling

[Pre-Chorus]
She'll hold your hand in the crowd (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
The kind of girl you'd write a song about

[Chorus]
Natalie
You move as natural as the breeze
Every sentence that you speak has a hold
Oh, Natalie
You're as wild as the sea
Could you teach me how to be so beautiful?
I'd like to know

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Natalie

[Verse 2]
She's always fun at parties
Walks in looking so carefree
She shines and I feel a little lighter
Brown hair right past her shoulders
Confidence that makes her seem older
I wish I was a little like her

[Pre-Chorus]
She'll hold your hand in the crowd (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
The kind of girl you'd write a song about

[Chorus]
Natalie
You move as natural as the breeze
Every sentence that you speak has a hold
Oh, Natalie
You're as wild as the sea
Could you teach me how to be so beautiful?
I'd like to know

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Natalie
(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Natalie

[Bridge]
Feel like the moon watching the sun
So many stars but she's the one
That everybody needs
(Oh, oh, oh-oh)
I'd like to be like that for once
How does it feel to be so loved?
Could you show me how to be?

[Chorus]
Natalie
You move as natural as the breeze
Every sentence that you speak has a hold
Oh, Natalie
You're as wild as the sea
Could you teach me how to be so beautiful?
I'd like to know

[Outro]
(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Natalie
(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Natalie
