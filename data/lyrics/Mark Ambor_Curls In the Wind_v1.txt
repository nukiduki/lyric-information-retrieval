[Verse]
You've been stuck inside a picket fence
I told you we could run away from common sense
It doesn't matter where it starts or where it ends
Just take my hand, take my hand

[Pre-Chorus]
Want to waste all my seconds away
Getting lost in a beautiful place
Open fields when I look at your face
Till forever fades

[Chorus]
A little bit of heaven on the weekend
Ocean full of sequins
Curls in the wind like (ooh)
A little bit of sun out when it's freezing
I don't need a reason
Tell me what you want to do

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ah
I like the way I feel with you
Said I like the way I feel with you
I like the way I feel and I don't know much
But I like the way I feel with you

[Verse]
Want you all over me
Set fire to the chemistry
Melting on a leather seat
Its paradise, oh
Don't you let go of me
My pain, my remedy
No place I would rather be, than in your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Want to waste all my seconds away
Getting lost in a beautiful place
Open fields when I look at your face
Till forever fades

[Chorus]
A little bit of heaven on the weekend
Ocean full of sequins
Curls in the wind like (ooh)
A little bit of sun out when it's freezing
I don't need a reason
Tell me what you want to do

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ah
I like the way I feel with you
Said I like the way I feel with you
I like the way I feel and I don't know much
But I like the way I feel with you
And I don't know much but I like the way I feel
