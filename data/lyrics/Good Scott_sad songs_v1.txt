[Verse 1]
Been a while, swimming in these waters, I-I-I
Been drifting on too long (Hey)
Tell me how do we cross these borders? I-I-I
'Cause it's all I'm dreaming of

[Pre-Chorus]
So why do we blame it on
Neon lights in the skyline?
Too many plans in the pipeline
No, it's never gonna feel right

[Chorus]
We're just in the jungle, tryna see the stars out
Listening to sad songs, tryna get the feels out
Play that one again, let's hear it 'til the end
'Cause I love being young and listening to sad songs (Sad songs)

[Verse 2]
Day and night, the light keeps falling, more-more-more
In this concrete canopy
But the balconies we're standing on, yeah
They're too tall for us to see

[Pre-Chorus]
So why do we blame it on
Neon lights in the skyline?
Too many plans in the pipeline
No, it's never gonna feel right

[Chorus]
We're just in the jungle, tryna see the stars out
Listening to sad songs, tryna get the feels out
Play that one again, let's hear it 'til the end
'Cause I love being young and listening to sad songs

[Bridge]
No more lights in the skyline
No more plans in the pipeline
Only you make me feel right
It's where I wanna be
Long days we're together
And these nights last forever
Could it ever get better?

[Chorus]
When we're just in the jungle, tryna see the stars out
Listening to sad songs, tryna get the feels out
Play that one again, let's hear it 'til the end
'Cause I love being young and listening to sad songs
We're just in the jungle, tryna see the stars out
Listening to sad songs, tryna get the feels out
Play that one again, let's hear it 'til the end
'Cause I love being young and listening to sad songs (Sad songs)
