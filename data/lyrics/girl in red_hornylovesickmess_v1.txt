[Chorus]
I'm in New York thinking of you
Wondering what you are up to
From this lonely ass hotel room
With a pretty good-looking view
I am somewhere in the states
Going somewhere on a plane
It doesn't really matter as long as I'm always far away

[Verse 1]
Or maybe on a bus for a month straight
Shit's fun but I'm going insane
Like it's been months since I've had sex
I'm just a horny, little, lovesick mess
And I don't wanna be the type of person who calls you up
Every time I need to get off, but
I guess that's who I'm turning into, oh fuck

[Chorus]
Down at Times Square in the rain
There's a billboard with my face
It's so weird how things have changed
Think about it every day
If I ever make it back
Will I find what we once had?
Guess I ruined us pretty bad, oh

[Verse 2]
I'm in the same city as you
But I still don't come through
'Cause I've got so much to do
And that's the shittiest excuse
So don't ever take me back
Let's just face the fact
I treated you like trash
And you deserve more than that

[Outro]
My love comes out at midnight
My love comes out at midnight
My love comes out at midnight
My love comes out at midnight
My love comes out at midnight
