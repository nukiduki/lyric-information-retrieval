[Verse 1: Ruth B.]
Put you first just like you wanted
Gave you me, you took for granted
Now here I am at twenty-eight
All my friends, I hardly know 'em
I don't sing, 'cause you're still broken
I almost threw it all away

[Pre-Chorus: Ruth B.]
How did we go from movies on Tuesdays
To all our memories packed in a suitcase?
Carried the weight for you for far too long

[Chorus: Ruth B.]
Even though I loved you, you know I had to leave
I guess I had to lose you on the way to finding me
'Cause they say, "Time heals all wounds"
But your wounds cut so deep
I guess I had to lose you on the way to finding me

[Verse 2: Dean Lewis]
It was hard to be thеre for you
When my dreams kеpt fallin' short, and
You were the only thing I knew
You were always there when I was fallin'
You promised me that you were all in
I made you everything and nothing all at once

[Chorus: Dean Lewis]
'Cause even though I loved you, you know I had to leave
I guess I had to lose you on the way to finding me
'Cause they say, "Time heals all wounds"
But your wounds cut so deep
I guess I had to lose you on the way to finding me

[Bridge: Ruth B. & Dean Lewis]
Yeah, I love you more than I love myself
And I hate that there is nobody else
Yeah, I love you more than I love myself
And I hate that there is nobody

[Chorus: Ruth B. & Dean Lewis]
'Cause even though I loved you, you know I had to leave
I guess I had to lose you on the way to finding me
'Cause they say, "Time heals all wounds"
But your wounds cut so deep
I guess I had to lose you on the way to finding me

[Outro: Dean Lewis, Ruth B., Ruth B. & Dean Lewis]
Even though I loved you, wish I didn't have to leave
I still just wanna hold you as you fall asleep
And I hope it all works out and you find everything you need
I guess I had to lose you on the way to finding me
