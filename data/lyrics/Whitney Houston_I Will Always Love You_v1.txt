[Verse 1]
If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you every step of the way

[Chorus]
And I
Will always love you
I will always love you

[Post-Chorus]
You
My darling, you
Mm, mm

[Verse 2]
Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So goodbye, please, don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need

[Chorus]
And I
Will always love you
I will always love you
You

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 3]
I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I wish to you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love
[Chorus]
And I
Will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you, I
I will always love you, you

[Outro]
Darling, I love you
Ooh, I'll always
I'll always love you
