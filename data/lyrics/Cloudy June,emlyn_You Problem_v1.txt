[Verse 1: Cloudy June]
Y-Y-Y-You and me are never gonna be
Anything as long as we can breathe (Uh)
Stupidly, I let you make a scene
Be a dick to fix your self-esteem

[Pre-Chorus: Cloudy June]
You call me every time, you're sleepless late at night
Your friends all think you suck, and you don't know why
You're really, really sad, you say you want me back
Now that you're at rock bottom

[Chorus: Cloudy June]
That sounds like a you problem
Karma's coming through problem
Getting comfy playing out the victim, what a change
Ooh, got 'em, now you're in my shoes problem
Breaking hearts and pointing fingers
But your only true problem is a y-y-you problem

[Post-Chorus: Cloudy June]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sounds like a you problem

[Verse 2: Emlyn]
Yes, oh please, please tell me what you think
I haven't heard a man talk shit in weeks
Truthfully, she's way out of your league
I'm empty on what's left of empathy

[Pre-Chorus: Emlyn]
You call her every time, you're sleepless late at night
Her friends all think you suck, including me, that's why
We don't care that you're sad, you only want her back
Now that you're at rock bottom

[Chorus: Cloudy June, Emlyn]
That sounds like a you problem
Karma's coming through problem
Getting comfy playing out the victim, what a change
Ooh, got 'em, now you're in my shoes problem
Breaking hearts and pointing fingers
But your only true problem is a y-y-you problem

[Post-Chorus: Cloudy June]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sounds like a you problem
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sounds like a you problem

[Bridge: Cloudy June, Emlyn]
Careful of the ones who claim they change
Come in hot with all the same old takes
Swear its so unfair to you, well babe
If you're looking for someone to blame

[Chorus: Cloudy June, Emlyn]
That sounds like a you problem
Karma's coming through problem
Getting comfy playing out the victim, what a change (Oh, what a change)
Ooh, got 'em, now you're in my shoes problem
Breaking hearts and pointing fingers
But your only true problem is a y-y-you problem

[Outro: Cloudy June, Emlyn]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) And you know it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Aah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah
Sounds like a you problem
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Ooh
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Ooh
Sounds like a you problem
