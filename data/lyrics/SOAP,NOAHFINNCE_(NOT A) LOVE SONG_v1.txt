[Intro: Ryan Lofthouse]
I won't write you a love song
No, I won’t write you a love song
(Love song)
(Lo-love song)

[Verse 1: Ryan Lofthouse]
I fell in love with a girl, how cliché
We met when I was just seventeen, she was eighteen
I know that makes a big difference in writing these days
But making me self aware makes it sound cooler to say
She's never been with a boy, that's hearsay
She doesn’t even know my last name, but it's okay
Or maybe I should sing about how she saw me first
But that wouldn't sound as cool as lying right through my shirt

[Chorus: Ryan Lofthouse]
I'd write you a love song but say nothing new
They're all overdone and we both know they're not true
It's the same old, same old, same old things
Fairies and unicorns, diamond rings
So I won't write you a love song (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
No, I won’t write you a love song (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Post-Chorus]
(Tell me more, tell me more)

[Verse 2: NOAHFINNCE, Ryan Lofthouse]
She wanted knockin’ off her feet but I'm a nice guy
Took me half a week to ask her out and I don’t know why
I thought I could be that guy (No), I don't wanna kill the mood (Okay)
Don't know what to tell you but I got your name tattooed
(What? Stop, wait)
Now I'm confused, I thought that’s what you wanted
Now my chorus is screwed

[Chorus: Ryan Lofthouse]
I'd write you a love song but say nothing new
They're all overdone and we both know they're not true
It's the same old, same old, same old things
Fairies and unicorns, diamond rings
So I won't write you a love song (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
No, I won't write you a love song (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Ryan, NOAHFINNCE]
No, I won't write you a love song (Write you a love song)
No, I won't write you a love song (Write you a love song)
'Cause it's the same old, same old, same old things (It's just the same old things)
Fairies and unicorns, diamond rings
So I won't write you a love song (I got it all wrong)
No, I won't write you a love song (I guess you wanted a love song)

[Outro]
(Love song)
(Lo-love song)
(Sounded ridiculous)
