[Chorus]
Do you know what love is?
Do you know what love is like?
Do you know what love is?
Know what love is like?

[Verse 1]
Moonlight and cinnamon trees
Late at night, I walk alone and breathe
Your eyes starin' at me
Lately, we've been walkin' on a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, it's more than a game
Feel the sun on your face
When we fall, will we stay?
Will we stay the same?

[Chorus]
Do you know what love is?
Do you know what love is like?
Do you know what love is?
Know what love is like?
Do you know what love is?
Do you know what love is like?
Do you know what love is?
Know what love is like?

[Verse 2]
Dark nights, your hands in mine
Silhouettes and shadows of thе night

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, it's more than a game
Feel the sun on your facе
When we fall, will we stay?
Will we stay the same?

[Chorus]
Do you know what love is?
Do you know what love is like?
Do you know what love is?
Know what love is like?
Do you know what love is?
Do you know what love is like?
Do you know what love is?
Know what love is like?

[Outro]
