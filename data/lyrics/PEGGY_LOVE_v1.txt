Let's be in love with each other
Tonight is the flight of the butterfly
Let's love

Show me
And find it a pleasure to know me
Tonight is the flight of the butterfly
Let's love

Come along
We're all alone
And if nobody calls us
We might spend the night on our own, mm-mm

Lover
Let's be in love and discover
That life is the flight of the butterfly
Let's love

Lover
Let's be in love and discover
That life is the flight of the butterfly
Let's love
