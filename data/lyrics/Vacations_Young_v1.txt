[Verse 1]
Another day goes by
And where was I?
Didn't think I'd still be here
Just to make things clear

[Chorus]
What's the use?
I'm not talking sense
Call it a ruse on myself
I wanted to go
I wanted to say
All things come to pass with time
But I want everything now to be all mine

[Verse 2]
You think it's all over
Get up and try again
You've got to act your age, darling
Before you fall back in

[Chorus]
What's the use?
I'm not talking sense
Call it a ruse on myself
I wanted to go
I wanted to say
All things come to pass with time
But I want everything now to be all mine
