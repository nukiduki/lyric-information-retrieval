[Intro]
Tell me was it real?

[Chorus]
So tell me was it real or was it just pretend?
Calling 'till the morning just to call again
I could never be the one to just be friends
Can we call again?
Can we fall again?

[Verse 1]
Can you write me in your stories?
That you're always talking about
And I promise they never bore me
When they're coming from your mouth
Tell your mama that I'm sorry
For the words I can't pronounce
She always said you were too good for me
And she glad I'm no longer around

[Chorus]
So tell me was it real or was it just pretend?
Calling 'till the morning just to call again
I could never be the one to just be friends
Can we call again?
Can we fall again?
So tell me all the places that you wanna see
If it were up to me we'd have a time machine
So I can take you all the places that you've never been
Just you and me making history

[Verse 2]
I find pieces of our life in my mind
Colors of the sky in your eyes
Fragments of the truth in your lies

[Chorus]
So tell me was it real or was it just pretend?
Calling 'till the morning just to call again
I could never be the one to just be friends
Can we call again?
Can we fall again?
So tell me all the places that you wanna see
If it were up to me we'd have a time machine
So I can take you all the places that you've never been
Just you and me making history

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me was it real?
Tell me was it real?
Tell me was it real?
Tell me was it real?

[Bridge]
I know that you're waiting for me
Tell me you adore me
Then you go and break my heart again
I know that you're perfect for me
Tell me that you're sorry
Won't you please just take my heart again

[Chorus]
So tell me was it real or was it just pretend?
Calling 'till the morning just to call again
I could never be the one to just be friends
Can we call again?
Can we fall again?
So tell me all the places that you wanna see
If it were up to me we'd have a time machine
So I can take you all the places that you've never been
Just you and me making history

[Outro]
Tell me was it real?
Tell me was it real?
Tell me, tell me, tell me was it real?
Tell me was it real?
Tell me, tell me, tell me was it real?
Tell me was it real?
Tell me, tell me, tell me was it real?
