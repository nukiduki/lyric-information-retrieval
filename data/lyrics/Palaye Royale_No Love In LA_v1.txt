[Verse 1]
Livin' in the moonlight
Lookin' at the hills, but the hills don't shine right
Lookin' at her nose, but the shit don't blow right
Gesundheit
Your mom says
"You can change your face, but the pain won't go away"
Addicted to the fame, but the fame is momentarily
Reality

[Pre-Chorus]
The creeps are crawling up to the doorways
They're dying to find out what's inside
The creeps are always posting their photos
To show off what they're lacking inside

[Chorus]
There is no such thing as love in LA
Plastic people don't got nothing to say
They're judging me, I'm judging you
We ain't got nothing else to do
Thеre's no such thing as love in LA

[Verse 2]
Livin' on Melrosе in motel rooms
Up all night drinkin' 'til the day shows
With the B-list and the C-list
And the demons comin' 'til I see shit
On a private jet
But you can't afford your rent
Gettin' high with fake friends
'Cause that's all you got

[Pre-Chorus]
The creeps are crawling up to the doorways
They're dying to find out what's inside
The creeps are always posting their photos
To show off what they're lacking inside

[Chorus]
There is no such thing as love in LA
Plastic people don't got nothing to say
They're judging me, I'm judging you
We ain't got nothing else to do
There's no such thing as love in LA

[Bridge]
I'm late for my own premiere
Maybe I should leave, my dear
I don't feel a thing out here
But it seems to me that the demons of the city
Wanna keep me here
They wanna keep me here

[Chorus]
There is no such thing as love in LA
Plastic people don't got nothing to say
They're judging me, I'm judging you
We ain't got nothing else to do
There's no such thing as love in LA
There is no such thing as love in LA
I said there's no such thing as love in LA
