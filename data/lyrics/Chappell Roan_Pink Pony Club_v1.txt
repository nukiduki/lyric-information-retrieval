[Verse 1]
I know you wanted me to stay
But I can't ignore the crazy visions of me in L.A. 
And I heard that there's a special place
Where boys and girls can all be queens every single day

[Refrain]
I'm having wicked dreams of leaving Tennessee
Hear Santa Monica, I swear it's calling me
Won't make my mama proud, it's gonna cause a scene
She sees her baby girl, I know she's gonna scream

[Pre-Chorus]
"God, what have you done?
You're a pink pony girl, and you dance at the club," oh mama
I'm just having fun
On the stage in my heels, it's where I belong, down at the

[Chorus]
Pink Pony Club, I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club, I'm gonna keep on dancing down in
West Hollywood, I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club, Pink Pony Club

[Verse 2]
I'm up and jaws are on the floor
Lovers in the bathroom and a line outside the door
Black lights and a mirrored disco ball
Every night's another reason why I left it all

[Refrain]
I thank my wicked dreams, a year from Tennessee
Oh, Santa Monica, you've been too good to me
Won't make my mama proud, it's gonna cause a scene
She sees her baby girl, I know she's gonna scream

[Pre-Chorus]
"God, what have you done?
You're a pink pony girl, and you dance at the club," oh mama
I'm just having fun
On the stage in my heels, it's where I belong, down at the

[Chorus]
Pink Pony Club, I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club, I'm gonna keep on dancing down in
West Hollywood, I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club, Pink Pony Club

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Don't think I've left you all behind
Still love you and Tennessee, you're always on my mind
And mama, every Saturday
I can hear your Southern drawl a thousand miles away, saying

[Pre-Chorus]
"God, what have you done?
You're a pink pony girl, and you dance at the club," oh mama
I'm just having fun
On the stage in my heels, it's where I belong, down at the

[Chorus]
Pink Pony Club, I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club, I'm gonna keep on dancing down in
West Hollywood, I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club, Pink Pony Club

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
I'm gonna keep on dancing
I'm gonna keep on dancing
