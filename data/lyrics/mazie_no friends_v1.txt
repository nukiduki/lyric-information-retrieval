[Chorus]
I don't have no fuckin' friends
I don't care, I'm not upset
I admit that I'm a mess
I don't have no fuckin' friends
Don't have fun, I don't make plans
I don't have no fuckin' friends

[Verse 1]
If less is more, then I'm doing the most
I'm so bored and I feel like a ghost
I don't wanna smoke
No more 'cause I'm broke
And my window won't open
God, my life is a joke

[Verse 2]
But then I wake up and I do it again
But then I'm livin' life and I don't have any friends
Like I said in the chorus
My life is so boring
And so unimportant
Guess I'll call my mom again, 'cause

[Chorus]
I don't have no fuckin' friends
I don't care, I'm not upset
I admit that I'm a mess
I don't have no fuckin' friends
Don't have fun, I don't make plans
I don't have no fuckin' friends

[Outro]
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
