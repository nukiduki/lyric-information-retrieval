[Verse 1]
A night to remember
Nothin' ever felt like
The moment I met her
Perfectly timed
What if I didn't go out that night
Took a left instead of a right?
Yeah, missed you by a red light
What could have been?

[Chorus]
Can you feel the chemical reaction?
You triggered my desire and attraction
Everything in me wants this to happen
But not tonight

[Verse 2]
Cocaine and weirdos
Maybe we should just get goin'
This is our window
To be alone
I wonder why sometimes you just know
'Cause this time was onе of those
Instantly mutual to my surprise

[Chorus]
Can you feel the chеmical reaction?
You triggered my desire and attraction
Everything in me wants this to happen
But not tonight
I don't believe things are meant to be
But now it doesn't apply to me
'Cause you and I
Are like stars aligned

[Bridge]
The balcony talk with the pinot noir
It could only lead to one thing tonight
So alluring by the bar
With those eyes and that charm
You're the only thing I had on my mind

[Outro]
It was a night to remember
Nothing ever felt like
The moment I met her
I met the rest of my life
The whisper in my ear
Saying, "Let's get outta here"
Yeah, I've never been so light on my feet
She had me wrapped around her finger
And I knew I had to have her
She was everything I've seen in my dreams
It was a night to remember
Nothing ever felt like
The moment I met her
I met the rest of my life
