[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Well, if you wanted honesty, that's all you had to say
I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way

[Pre-Chorus]
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor?

[Chorus]
I'm not okay, I'm not okay, hey hey, hey
I'm not okay, hey, hey
You wear me out

[Verse 2]
What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words, but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)

[Pre-Chorus]
To be a joke and, look, another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

[Chorus]
I'm not okay, I'm not okay, hey, hey, hey
I'm not okay, hey, hey
You wear me out
[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed now

[Bridge]
But I'm okay, I'm okay
I'm okay now, (I'm okay now), but you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay
Trust me

[Chorus]
I'm not okay, I'm not okay
Well, I'm not okay, I'm not o-fucking-kay
I'm not okay, hey, hey, I'm not okay, â€”kay
