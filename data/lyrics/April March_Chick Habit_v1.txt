[Chrorus]
Hang up the chick habit
Hang it up, daddy
Or you'll be alone in a quick

Hang up the chick habit
Hang it up, daddy
Or you'll never get another fix

I'm telling you it's not a trick
Pay attention, don't be thick
Or you're liable to get licked

You're gonna see the reason why
When they're spittin' in your eye
They'll be spittin' in your eye

[Verse 1]
Hang up the chick habit
Hang it up, daddy
A girl's not a tonic or a pill

Hang up the chick habit
Hang it up, daddy
You're just jonesin' for a spill

[Verse 2]
Oh, how your bubble's gonna burst
When you meet another nurse
She'll be driving in a hearse
You're gonna need a heap of glue
When they all catch up with you
And they cut you up in two

[Verse 3]
Now your ears are ringing
The birds have stopped their singing
Everything is turning grey
No candy in your till
No cutie left to thrill
You're alone on a Tuesday

[Chorus]
Hang up the chick habit
Hang it up, daddy
Or you'll be alone in a quick

Hang up the chick habit
Hang it up, daddy
Or you'll never get another fix

I'm tellin' you it's not a trick
Pay attention, don't be thick
Or you're liable to get licked

You're gonna see the reason why
When they're spittin' in your eye
They'll be spittin' in your eye

[Outro]
You're gonna see the reason why
When they're spittin' in your eye
They'll be spittin' in your eye

You're gonna see the reason why
When they're spittin' in your eye
They'll be spittin' in your eye

You're gonna see the reason why
When they're spittin' in your eye
They'll be spittin' in your eye

You're gonna see the reason...
