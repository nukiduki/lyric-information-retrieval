[Verse 1]
I'm a girl in a world, everything is made of metal
Iron shell full of pearls and I’m pretty as a petal
But you're unaware, got you preoccupied
We're right there, really wanna see you terrified

[Pre-Chorus]
Tripped out wires, starting fires
Looks so pretty, I’m a deathtrap, darling
Overloaded, poorly coded
Can't control it, losing focus

[Chorus]
(Oh, my God)
You've got yourself a rogue bot
She's gunnin' for the killshot
Malfunctioning again, you know heads will roll
Get ready for the end, she's irrational

[Verse 2]
Steel bones, but the outside's so warm
Bright light in a middle of a snowstorm
I'll invitе you in, inching underneath your skin
And I know you’ll start to wonder whеre did all of this begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Tripped out wires, starting fires
Looks so pretty, I’m a deathtrap, darling
Overloaded, poorly coded
Can't control it, losing focus

[Chorus]
(Oh, my God)
You’ve got yourself a rogue bot
She's gunnin' for the killshot
Malfunctioning again, you know heads will roll
Get ready for the end, she's irrational
(Oh, my God)
You’ve got yourself a rogue bot
She's gunnin' for the killshot
Malfunctioning again, you know heads will roll
Get ready for the end, she's irrational

[Outro]
You've got yourself a rogue bot
You've got yourself a rogue bot
You've got yourself a rogue bot
You've got yourself, got yourself
