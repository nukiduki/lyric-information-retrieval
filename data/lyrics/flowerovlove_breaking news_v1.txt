[Intro]
I'm obsessed, I'm obsessed  and I can't admit it
Hmm, mm-mm-mm
Mm, mm-mm-mm

[Verse 1]
It's so unnatural, way you got me wrapped up
Yeah, you got me hooked up
Yeah, you got me loved up
It's so magical what you do with one touch
Yeah, you got me unstuck
Yeah, you got me love-struck

[Pre-Chorus]
Hi, hello
You've been running circles in my head, you know
You said we were gonna take it nice and slow
And now I'm telling everyone I know
And it's looking alright with me, so

[Chorus]
If it's okay with you (With you)
I think I'm gonna love you for a long time
Baby, it's breaking news (Ooh-ooh)
I think I'm gonna love you for my whole life
If you wanna know the truth
Nothing will ever compare to the way you do
If it's okay with you
I think I'm gonna love you, gonna love you for a very long
Time, time
Time, time, and time

[Verse 2]
It's such a headache how you got me in knots
How you're up in my thoughts
Sound like, "Bla-bla-bla-bla" (Bla, bla)
It's so dramatic how you're all that I've got
How you love me non-stop
And your hair is so hot

[Pre-Chorus]
Hi, hello (Hello)
You've been running circles in my head, you know (You know)
You said we were gonna take it nice and slow
And now I'm telling everyone I know
And it's looking alright with me, so

[Chorus]
If it's okay with you (With you)
I think I'm gonna love you for a long time
Baby, it's breaking news (Ah, ah, ah)
I think I'm gonna love you for my whole life
If you wanna know the truth (If you wanna know the truth)
Nothing will ever compare to the way you do
If it's okay with you
I think I'm gonna love you, gonna love you for a very long
Time, time
Time, time, and time (For a very long time)
Time, time
Time, time, and time

[Outro]
It's such a headache how you got me in knots
How you're up in my thoughts
Sound like, "Bla-bla-bla-bla"
