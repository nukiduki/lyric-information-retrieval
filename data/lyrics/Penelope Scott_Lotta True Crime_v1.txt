[Verse 1]
So this girl's out back behind the bar
She's a good girl, she called a car
You got three motherfuckers in a big white van
Two dumb friends and one mean man
Well she'll fuckin' kill you, she wins every fight
She's gonna rock your shit by the end of the night
And the only advantage that a killer has
Is they think they have the right

[Chorus 1]
I listen to a lotta True Crime
I listen to it at night
I like the girl talk
It makes me feel alright
I like scary stories in the morning
And I like 'em at night
I like the girl talk vibes
They make me feel just fine
I listen to a lotta True Crime

[Interlude]
"Ya' know, Dennis Rader and David Parker Ray actually sit together in Hell
Shaking, quaking, terrified that one day, somehow, someway
They might meet me."

[Verse 2]
They took our girls away from home
They're in the woods, they're all alone
The ropes are heavy and the knots are tight
Tied by a monster and his oblivious wife
Well I hope this doesn't seem too impolite
But Ted Bundy was just never that fuckin' bright
He was just sorta charismatic and white, alright?
And he was so fuckin' sure he had the right

[Chorus 2]
But he's ugly, and I’m glad he's dead
'Cause there was no fuckin' candle in his pumpkin head
You're not special for winning a game
With someone who you know was never playing
She could've killed you, she had every right
You just caught her off guard tonight
But it's alright, she'll be fine
We listen to a lotta True Crime

[Bridge]
One of our young turned up last night
They found their body but not their eyes
Somebody new must've gone bad
Where's the lord to take care of that?
Where is the lord to take care of that?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 1]
I listen to a lotta True Crime
I listen to it at night
I like the girl talk vibes
They make me feel alright
I like scary stories in the morning
And I like 'em at night
I like the girl talk vibes
They make me feel just fine
I listen to a lotta true crime

[Outro]
Oooo!
