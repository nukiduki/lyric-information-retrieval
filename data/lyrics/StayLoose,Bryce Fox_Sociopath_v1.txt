[Intro]
Hey!

[Verse 1]
The feelings I caught, the time that I lost
Said it's tough looking back when I thought what I thought
Yeah, I feel ashamed, embarrassed with rage
So I bloody the rain on your pity parade

[Pre-Chorus]
So cry, cry, cry I don't need you in my life
Need you in my life, no
So cry, cry, cry you don't even have to try
Don't even have to try (fuckin ho')

[Chorus]
I didn't know you were a sociopath
I didn't know you were a sociopath

[Verse 2]
So you been living two lives with two guys
Bet you got your tubes tied
Heard a lotta this, a lotta that, a lotta lotta lies
The other night your mom passed away and it was weird
That you just went about your day and didn't even shed a tear
I feel bad you don't feel bad, sad you don't feel sad
But I'm the last to help a crazy bitch that goes behind my back

[Chorus]
I didn't know you were a sociopath
I didn't know you were a sociopath

[Bridge]
They say that love kills (say that love kills)
It ain't not quite what it seems (ain't not quite as it seems)
Don't be shocked when you lost what you called meant to be
Say I feel afraid, 'cause your crazy's for days
You said he wasn't me and it don't mean a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
So cry, cry, cry I don't need you in my life
Need you in my life, no
So cry, cry, cry you don't even have to try
Don't even have to try (fuckin ho')

[Chorus]
I didn't know you were a sociopath
I didn't know you were a sociopath
I didn't know you were a sociopath
I didn't know you were a sociopath
