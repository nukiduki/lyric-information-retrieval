[Verse 1]
I cannot hide my cards, dear
Can't even keep them close
I've seen how swiftly thoughts can
Collect into ghosts
When you should fear them most

[Pre-Chorus]
I am not a coward
I am just afraid
Of how our new tomorrow
Will turn to yesterday

[Chorus]
So long, so long
You know I understand
So long, so long
I'll see you when I can
When I can

[Verse 2]
You and I spoke last night
As I lay next to him
You told me if you fallowed
Every paper whim
You'd be wearing thin

[Pre-Chorus]
I woke up with a longing
For just that mistake
Your ghost was calling
I was just beyond the break

[Chorus]
So long, so long
You know I understand
So long, so long
I'll see you when I can
When I can

[Verse 3]
I'd like to tell you now, dear
To pry open the door
I'd appeal to your body
To take me on the floor
To ask a ghost for more

[Pre-Chorus]
The glorious will always
Be just around the bend
But I can't ask to borrow
What I can't bear to lend

[Chorus]
So long, so long
You know I understand
So long, so long
I'll see you when I can
When I can
