[Verse 1]
She said, "I'll take the left side tonight, I don't mind
I know you've got a call to take at 9
I'll sleep against the wall, even if it hurts my back
I'll take some Tylenol, you don't worry about that"

[Pre-Chorus]
I always told her that I'd buy a bigger mattress
Finally made some money, funny how it happens
Got so caught up, forgot who I was, forgot about us

[Chorus]
Bought a king-size bed when I lost my queen
Thinkin' maybe then she'll come back to me, but
I'm here by myself instead
Lookin' stupid in my king-size bed
She's in my head and she's in my dreams
Thinkin' maybe she'll come back to me, but
I'm here by myself instead
Lookin' stupid in my king-size bed

[Verse 2]
Take the cold floor tonight, think I might
Sleep by the door and keep on the light
Like you did for me, would only be right
I do the same for you, so alright

[Pre-Chorus]
It's better late than never, so I'm sleeping on the ground
I owed you so much better, baby, you deserved a crown
And though we're not together, I still hope you'll come around
I hope you'll come around

[Chorus]
Bought a king-size bed when I lost my queen
Thinkin' maybe then she'll come back to me, but
I'm here by myself instead
Lookin' stupid in my king-size bed
She's in my head and she's in my dreams
Thinkin' maybe she'll come back to me, but
I'm here by myself instead
Lookin' stupid in my king-size bed

[Bridge]
Oh, I bought the bed, I bought the bed
Oh, I bought the bed, I bought the bed
Oh, I bought the bed, I bought the bed
Oh, just like I said, I bought the bed
Oh, I bought the bed, I bought the bed
Oh, I bought the bed, I bought the bed
Oh, I bought the bed, I bought the bed
Oh, just like I said, I bought the bed

[Chorus]
Bought a king-size bed when I lost my queen
Thinkin' maybe then she'll come back to me, but
I'm here by myself instead
Lookin' stupid in my king-size bed
She's in my head and she's in my dreams
Thinkin' maybe she'll come back to me, but
I'm here by myself instead
Lookin' stupid in my king-size bed
