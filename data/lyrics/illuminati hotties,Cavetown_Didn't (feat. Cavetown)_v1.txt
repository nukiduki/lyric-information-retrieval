[Verse 1]
Left out
Lawless
Promise
I know impossible truth
Vicious
Sick of it
My way
I won't do it
Wanna
Finish
What if

[Chorus]
What if I just didn't?
Didn't do it
Didn't do it
Didn't do it
What if I just didn't?

[Verse 2]
Listen
Honest
There's so much
That I'm expected to do
I feel
So insufficient
Yeah, I'm not
Engineered quite like you
Ambition
Intermittent
Then I think

[Chours]
Well, what if I just didn't?
Didn't do it
Didn't do it
Didn't do it
What if I justâ€”
Didn't do it
Didn't do it
Didn't do it
What if I just didn't?

[Outro]
Do what you want to
You know I'm so unenthused
I don't want to
What if I just didn't?
Do what you want to
You know I'm so unenthused
I don't want to
What if I just didn't?
