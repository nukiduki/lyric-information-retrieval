[Intro: Sophia]
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
Thought about you way too much, much, much, much, much
Over, overthinking us, us, us, us, us (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause you been so out of touch
You could've had my love, but you been so out of touch

[Verse 1: Megan & Daniela]
Monday, I was dreaming 'bout ya
Tuesday, I was waiting near the phone
Two days, wasn't hearing from ya
Yeah, what can I say? Oh, baby, I was getting bored
Thursday, I was losing interest
Friday, you were out there in the cold
Weekend, you already missed it
I was moving on 'cause you were moving too slow

[Pre-Chorus: Lara]
'Cause sometimes I'm alone
Stare out my window
And the moon makes you seem close tonight

[Chorus: Yoonchae & Manon]
But you been so out of touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
Thought about you way too much, much, much, much, much
Over, overthinking us, us, us, us, us
'Cause you been so out of touch
You could've had my love, but you been so out of
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
Thought about you way too much, much, much, much, much
Yeah, you went and messed it up, up, up, up, up
'Cause you been so out of touch
You could've had my love, but you been so out of touch

[Verse 2: Megan, Daniela & Sophia]
First, you're gonna say you're sorry
Promise you won't do it anymore
Come up with a different story
Yeah, what can I say, say something I ain't heard before
I'm too fun to waste my time
Too young to waste one night
So here comes some good advice
If I ever call again, don't press ignore

[Pre-Chorus: Lara & Sophia]
'Cause sometimes I'm alone
Stare out my window
And the moon makes you seem close tonight (Woo)

[Chorus: Yoonchae & Manon]
But you been so out of touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
Thought about you way too much, much, much, much, much
Over, overthinking us, us, us, us, us
'Cause you been so out of touch
You could've had my love, but you been so out of
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch (Ah-Ah)
Thought about you way too much, much, much, much, much
Yeah, you went and messed it up, up, up, up, up
'Cause you been so out of touch
You could've had my love, but you been so out of touch
