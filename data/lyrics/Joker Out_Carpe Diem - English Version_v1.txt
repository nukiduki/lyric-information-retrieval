[Intro]
We'll dance and play until the stars fade
Across the sky, we're writing our names
Got no regrets, we want it all

[Verse 1]
Running out of words, silence hurts
Truth as thin as ice
Time to escape all the drama
They're looking for a fight, every night
It's written in their eyes
There's no escaping the karma

[Verse 2]
(Eeny, meeny, miny, moe) You won't catch me, don't you know
(Give me what belongs to me) No, because I'll take it all
(Ah, ah, ah) We should be taking back control

[Pre-Chorus]
Wе'll play our love against your hate
Don't you count on us to let you win today
Today

[Chorus]
Wе'll dance and play until the stars fade (Ah-ah)
Across the sky, we're writing our names (Ah-ah)
Got no regrets, we want it all (Got no regrets, we want it all)
Won't count the hours 'til the sunrise (Ah-ah)
Let's leave a mark before our goodbyes (Ah-ah)
To fill our hearts and our souls

[Verse 3]
Waiting for the rain to wash away
Everything the shadow dancers say
As we light up with the fall of dusk

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll play our love against your hate
Don't you count on us to let you win today
Let me hear you say

[Chorus]
We'll dance and play until the stars fade (Ah-ah)
Across the sky, we're writing our names (Ah-ah)
Got no regrets, we want it all (Got no regrets, we want it all)
Won't count the hours 'til the sunrise (Got no regrets, we want it all)
Let's leave a mark before our goodbyes (Got no regrets, we want it all)
Because we're only fully alive this moment in time
No mountain we can't climb

[Outro]
We danced and played until the sun came
Writing a story using our names
About a generation not afraid to seize the day
