[Verse 1]
Run with the devil, go ahead run free
Run with the devil and dream
Smoke that cigarette, puff those rings
Blow it in my face as I breathe
It's alright now, you're just high now
You'll be fine now, you're just high now
Look at your mama, now she's crying
'Cause she thinks her baby's dying
Don't put up a fight, she just wants to hold you tight
And look at your daddy, he hates lying
Tried to help you, but he's sick of trying
Look at your life, he just wants to make it right

[Pre-Chorus]
And you got everything and more than enough
If you could have anything, what would you want?

[Chorus]
You say you wanna die young
Wanna die young
You say, "I wanna die young"
Wanna die young

[Verse 2]
Sleep with the devil, go dance with him
It's your life, you do what you want to
Baby, why you so locked up in lies?
Don't you know you could have the truth?
You say I'm boring, so you ignore me
You hear the phone ring, so you ignore me
Look at your mama, now she's crying
'Cause she thinks her baby's dying
Don't put up a fight, she just wants to hold you tight
And look at your daddy, he hates lying
Tried to help you, but he's sick of trying
Look at your life, he just wants to make it right

[Pre-Chorus]
And you got everything and more than enough
If you could have anything, what would you want?

[Chorus]
You say you wanna die young
Wanna die young
You say, "I wanna die young"
Wanna die young

[Bridge]
You say, "I don't know how I lost myself"
With a bottle and the bottom of an ashtray
Smoking my regrets and realizing what I need to do is pray (Pray)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know I've got more than enough
And I think I know now what I really want

[Chorus]
And I think I want love, wanna find love
And I wanna be loved, wanna find love
And I sure as hell don't wanna die young
Don't wanna die young, wanna die young
