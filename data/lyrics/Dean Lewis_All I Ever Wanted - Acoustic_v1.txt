[Verse 1]
Darlin'
I'm a long way from home now
Wastin' away, it's been a long time since
I've seen your face
And I hope that I'll hold you again

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause sometimes I feel, feel like I'm fallin'
Layin' in bed, just hopin' you'd walk in
All my mistakes, oh, I took you for granted
I was lookin' for somethin' when I already had it

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted
Was to love you like you loved me when nobody else was watchin'
And we'd stay awake 'til five in the mornin'
All I ever wanted
Was to go back to the days when we were young and made a promise
That we'd never change, but if I'm bein' honest
All I ever wanted was you

[Verse 2]
Please pick up your phone, I'll call it again
Just tell me you miss me, tell me you love me, call me a friend
I'm alone in the night sky but caught on the outside

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause sometimes I feel, feel like I'm fallin'
Caught in my head, still hopin' you'd walk in
Take me straight back to the night we went drivin'
By the car park with the roof down, didn't care where we were goin'

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted
Was to love you like you loved me when nobody else was watchin'
And we'd stay awake 'til five in the mornin'
All I ever wanted
Was to go back to the days when we were young and made a promise
That we'd never change, but if I'm bein' honest
All I ever wanted was you

[Bridge]
Oh-oh, I'm sorry that it took me a while to figure it out
I miss you more than you know
I'm comin' home soon, oh-oh

[Chorus]
'Cause all I ever wanted
Was to love you like you loved me when nobody else was watchin'
And we'd stay awake 'til five in the mornin'
All I ever wanted
Was to go back to the days when we were young and made a promise
That we'd never change, but if I'm bein' honest
All I ever wanted was you
