[Chorus]
Was it all in my head?
Was it meant to be?
Thought I'd love you 'til death
Now you're dead to me
But I still fucking hate you, hate you, hate you
What are you doing to me?
Thought I'd love you 'til death
Now you're dead to me

[Verse 1]
You fuckin' broke me, I'm crazy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you were my baby
I wasn't perfect, but I worked so hard
You still called me lazy
Had to leave the shit
All the shit you were doin' to me
Called me so many names
Started to believe
Made me fuckin' hate myself
You never wanted me, you wanted someone else
You made our home start to feel like a cell
Took a look in a mirror and I started to see
A man who wanted some love you could never give to me

[Chorus]
Was it all in my head?
Was it meant to be?
Thought I'd love you 'til death
Now you're dead to me
But I still fucking hate you, hate you, hate you
What are you doing to me?
Thought I'd love you 'til death
Now you're dead to me

[Verse 2]
Wasn't perfect, always flirtin' with different women
And gettin' too fucked up, we couldn't even have a conversation
But what you did was worse, it was fuckin' inhuman
I caught you in bed with another man, just left feelin' stupid
I went home, and thinking and drinking and finished a gram
I got madder and madder, and I ripped him out of bed
You were screamin', and me and him were fightin' on the floor
I had blood spillin' out my head, leaving from the door
I was wearing shades the next day 'cause you knew I was meeting fans
It was the lowest point I ever fucking felt as a man
I got hate in my heart and an endless aggression
I can't let it all go until you answer my question

[Chorus]
Was it all in my head?
Was it meant to be?
Thought I'd love you 'til death
Now you're dead to me
But I still fucking hate you, hate you, hate you
What are you doing to me?
Thought I'd love you 'til death
Now you're dead to me
Now you're dead to me
Now you're dead to me

[Bridge]
I couldn't see it then, but I see it now
Thank you so fuckin' much for ripping my heart out
For stomping it and cutting it, and bleeding it out
Finally figured out so much about myself
I was never the problem, I can finally see
You just weren't the right fuckin' person for me
Take care, wish you well and the best
Hoping our paths never cross again
Said what I had to and needed to say
Going to love myself like I should have yesterday

[Chorus]
Was it all in my head?
Was it meant to be?
Thought I'd love you 'til death
But now you're dead to me
But I still fucking hate you, hate you, hate you
What are you doing to me?
Thought I'd love you 'til death
Now you're dead to me (Now you're dead to me)
Now you're dead to me (Now you're dead to me)
Fuckin' dead, dead, dead, dead (Dead to me)
Fuckin' dead, dead, dead, you're dead to me
