[Verse 1]
It's 2 a.m., hear the cellular ringin'
Got the curious feelin' you're fiendin' for love
But the thing is, we haven't spoken for weeks
I love you bad, that's the problem occurrin'
Better love I deserve, and I'm hurtin'
But sadly, I worship every moment we meet

[Pre-Chorus]
So you take and you take 'cause you know you can
And I chase as you're chasin' another man
Try to break, see your face and I know that I can't

[Chorus]
Oh
You're killing me
You're not makin' it easy (Ah-ah-ah)
Too busy deceivin' and cheatin' and lyin' and competin'
To know how lucky you are
You're killing me
I just want you to free me (Ah-ah-ah)
And though I am cryin' and bleedin' and barely breathin'
I can't let go of your heart

[Verse 2]
I take your call, you say, "What's the matter?"
Then you lie to me faster and faster, you're such a good actor
I hear your car in the driveway

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're tossin' a rock at my windowpane
Said, "I don't wanna talk, just go away"
But you claw at the locks 'til I let you invade

[Chorus]
Oh
You're killing me (Killing)
You're not makin' it easy (Ah-ah-ah)
Too busy deceivin' and cheatin' and lyin' and competin'
To know how lucky you are
You're killing me (Killing)
I just want you to free me (Ah-ah-ah)
And though I am cryin' and bleedin' and barely breathin'
I can't let go of your heart

[Bridge]
I wanna die, but you keep me alive
You're killing me, you're killing me
I wanna die, but you keep me alive
You're killing me, you're killing me
I wanna die, but you keep me alive
You're killing me, you're killing me
Fight to survive, oh, love of my life
You're killing me

[Chorus]
Oh-oh
You're killing me (Killing)
You're not makin' it easy (Ah-ah-ah)
Too busy deceivin' and cheatin' and lyin' and competin'
To know how lucky you are (Oh)
You're killing me (Killing)
I just want you to free me (Ah-ah-ah)
And though I am cryin' and bleedin' and barely breathin'
I can't let go of your heart

[Outro]
I wanna die but you keep me alive
You're killing me (Killing), you're killing me (Killing, oh-oh)
I wanna die but you keep me alive
No, I can't let go of your heart
You're killing me (Ha)
