[Intro: Lucky Dog]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogieman

[Verse 1: Elliot Lee]
I am tortured by the fear of being mean
I've lost sleep ruminating on morality
I've torn away my layers to disarm
'Cause I'm terrified of doing any harm

[Pre-Chorus: Elliot Lee]
But they whisper in the night
It rides the cooling breeze
Corrupted by their fright
So terrified of me
And they whisper in the night
It rides the cooling breeze
Corrupted by their fright
So terrified of me

[Chorus: Elliot Lee, Lucky Dog]
Beware (of the Boogieman) of the Boogieman, beware
They circulate their lies
With fire in their eyes
But I'm not the one that's scary (Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogieman)
Beware (of the Boogieman) of the Boogieman, beware
They spin their fantasies
Condemn reality
But I'm not the one that's scary
(Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogieman)

[Verse 2: Baby Bugs]
I keep altering myself
Turning into someone else
And I don't know
How to let go
Of fearing for their thoughts
If they like me or not
I have to watch them grow
While I tiptoe

[Pre-Chorus]
But they whisper in the night
And it rides the cooling breeze
Corrupted by their fright
So terrified of me
And they whisper in the night
And it rides the cooling breeze
Corrupted by their fright
So terrified of me

[Chorus: Elliot Lee & Baby Bugs. Lucky Dog]
Beware (of the Boogieman) of the Boogieman, beware
They circulate their lies
With fire in their eyes
But I'm not the one that's scary (Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogieman)
Beware (of the Boogieman) of the Boogieman, beware
They spin their fantasies
Condemn reality
But I'm not the one that's scary
(Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogieman)

[Interlude: Elliot Lee]
Nanana, nanana, woah oh oh oh
Nanana, nanana, woah oh oh oh
Nanana, nanana, woah oh oh oh

[Chorus: Elliot Lee & Baby Bugs. Lucky Dog]
Beware (of the Boogieman) of the Boogieman, beware
They circulate their lies
With fire in their eyes
But I'm not the one that's scary (Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogieman)
Beware (of the Boogieman) of the Boogieman, beware
They spin their fantasies
Condemn reality
But I'm not the one that's scary
(Boogie, Boogie, Boogie, Boogieman)
