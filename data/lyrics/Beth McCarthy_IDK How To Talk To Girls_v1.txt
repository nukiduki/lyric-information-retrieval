[Verse 1]
Do I buy her a drink?
If I ask for her name or her sign
Am I gonna sink or swim?
I'll probably drown in her eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Overthinking everything
Feel the panic setting in
Truth is I've never been good at
Knowing if she'd even like me like that

[Chorus]
I wanna get to know her
Wait…
I don't know how to talk to girls
I'm losing my cool and
It's stupid, I can never find the words
I'm not usually like this
Butterflies with girls hit different
I wanna get to know her
Oh shit…
I don't know how to talk to girls

[Verse 2]
Is she looking at me?
Did she smile? Am I crazy?
'Cause I think I forgot how to breathe
Don't know how to flirt in real life
'Cause I never took it further than an Instagram like, ha!

[Pre-Chorus]
Overthinking everything
Feel the panic setting in
Truth is I've never been good at
Knowing if she'd even like me like that

[Chorus]
I wanna get to know her
Wait…
I don't know how to talk to girls
I'm losing my cool and
It's stupid, I can never find the words
I'm not usually like this (I'm not usually like this)
Butterflies with girls hit different
I wanna get to know her
Oh shit…
I don't know how to talk to— (Girls)
I don't know how to talk to girls (Girls)

[Bridge]
Awkwardly obsessive and I'm overly interested
Try too hard 'cause I don't wanna mess it up
How do I say that I like her like that?
Knowing if she'd even like me like that
Oh my God! She's coming over
Think this might be my moment to buy her a drink
And she says, "What's your name?"
And I can't remember it

[Chorus]
I'm losing my cool and
It's stupid, I can never find the words
I'm not usually like this (I'm not usually like this)
Butterflies with girls hit different
I wanna get to know her
Oh shit…
I don't know how to talk to— (Girls)
I don't know how to talk to girls (Girls)
I don't know how to talk to girls
