[Verse 1]
Fake a smile, fake an orgasm
Fake a laugh, do it all for him
Be polite, spend the night
Call it self-defense
Got the time of his life at my own expense

[Pre-Chorus]
But even if he were my man
He'd never truly understand

[Chorus]
What it means to be a girl
Put ribbons in my curls
Then carry around a knife with my diamonds
It's psycho, we're living in a world
Where I get into clubs because I'm hot as fuck
But I don't trust what's in my cup
That's what it means to be a girl

[Verse 2]
Take his name, give your sanity
Take the blame, put his mind at ease
Trade it all for a false sense of security
Fall in love, fall in line with all his fantasies

[Pre-Chorus]
But even if he were my man
He'd never truly understand

[Chorus]
What it means to be a girl
Put ribbons in my curls
Then carry around a knife with my diamonds
It's psycho, we're living in a world
Where I get into clubs because I'm hot as fuck
But I don't trust what's in my cup
That's what it means to be a girl

[Bridge]
Fake it till we make everyone happy but ourselves
Use us for our bodies till there's nothing but a shell
It's a mutual experience we're not supposed to tell
And don't act like you have felt

[Chorus]
What it means to be a girl
Put ribbons in my curls
Then carry around a knife with my diamonds
It's psycho, we're living in a world
Where I get into clubs because I'm hot as fuck
But I don't trust what's in my cup
That's what it means to be a girl
What it means to be a girl
What it means to be a girl
