[Verse 1]
The first day I met you
I knew that love was true
And all I wanted to do
Was make some sticky glue
I went straight up the stairs
Growling like a grizzly bear
And I was nearly there
I said his name

[Chorus 1]
(Toby) Yeah, you are the one
(Toby) Let me introduce you to my mum
You are my friend
(Toby) But I just want you there, in my bed
We could be two, let me Shaggy and Scooby on top of you
You will be mine (Toby)
My little clementine

[Verse 2]
Forward to the first time we mеt
I looked at your face and my balls start to sweat
Watching you buzz likе a bee
You made me gay, how can you not see?
You are my tasty snack
Being with you is like smoking crack
Marry me, be my wife
This goes out to the love of my life

[Chorus 2]
(Toby) Yeah, you are the one
(Toby) Let me put my finger up your bum
(Toby) You are my friend
(Toby) But I just want you there, in my bed
You will be mine
My little clementine
