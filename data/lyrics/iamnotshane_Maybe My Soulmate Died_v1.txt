[Verse 1]
I never got your number
Am I reading into your smile
Or am I reading between your lips?
Was that a spark, am I imagining this?

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe you got somewhere to be
And I'm afraid of what the answer will be
So instead, I watch you leave

[Chorus]
Maybe my soulmate died, I don't know, maybe I don't have a soul
What if I saw you on the train last night and I just walked on by?
What if I never let you in? And now you're with somebody who did
All of this miscommunication, indecisiveness, be patient

[Verse 2]
Not the type to take a risk
But now I'm worried I'll regret this
It's a fear of rеjection
It's a hope for redеmption

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe you got somewhere to be
And I'm afraid of what the answer will be
Instead, I watch you leave

[Chorus]
Maybe my soulmate died, I don't know, maybe I don't have a soul
What if I saw you on the train last night and I just walked on by?
What if I never let you in? And now you're with somebody who did
All of this miscommunication, indecisiveness, be patient

[Bridge]
Always second-guessing
Always second-guessing (Maybe my soulmate died)
Always second-guessing
Always second-guessing

[Chorus]
Maybe my soulmate died, I don't know, maybe I don't have a soul
What if I saw you on the train last night and I just walked on by?
