[Intro]
La da da da dum, dum da dum
La da da da dum

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, I was tryna be a cool kid
So I said to the devil, I could do whatever you did
Drink some wine to wash my tongue
Smoke some weed to clean my lungs
I woke up feeling like I didn't know my name

[Pre-Chorus]
I fell too deep to turn it back around
I sell myself too quickly to the crowd
I'm drowning in demons staring at me
As I fall from the ceiling, I start hearing

[Chorus]
Voices in my head
They said, they said
Take another breath
Instead, instead of
Panicking again, dancing with adrenaline
I've been making friends with the
The voices in my head

[Post-Chorus]
La da da da dum, dum da dum
La da da da dum, dum da dum
La da da da dum, dum da dum
Dum da dum, dum-

[Verse 2]
I'm afraid, all the blood is rushing up inside my skull
As I lay on my sofa, check the tempo of my pulse
Scatter brained, out of balance
Is this damaging my heart?
How can chemistry control me?
Can it hold me in the dark?

[Pre-Chorus]
I fell too deep to turn it back around
I sell myself too quickly to the crowd
I'm drowning in demons staring at me
As I fall from the ceiling, I start hearing

[Chorus]
Voices in my head
They said, they said
Take another breath
Instead, instead of
Panicking again, dancing with adrenaline
I've been making friends with the
The voices in my head

[Outro]
La da da da dum, dum da dum
La da da da dum, dum da dum
La da da da dum, dum da dum
The voices in my head
La da da da dum, dum da dum
La da da da dum, dum da dum
I've been making friends with the
The voices in my head
