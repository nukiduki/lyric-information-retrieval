[Verse 1]
Insecure in her skin
Like a puppet, a girl on a string
Broke away, learned to fly
If you want her back, gotta let her shine

[Chorus]
So it looks like the joke's on you
’Cause the girl that you thought you knew
She's so gone, that's so over now
She’s so gone, you won't find her around
You can look, but you won't see the girl I used to be
'Cause she, she's so gone

[Verse 2]
Here I am, this is me
And I'm stronger than you ever thought I'd be
Are you shocked? Are you mad?
That you're missing out on who I really am

[Chorus]
Now it looks like the joke’s on you
’Cause the girl that you thought you knew
She's so gone (She’s so gone), that's so over now
She's so gone (She's so gone), you won’t find her around
You can look (She's so gone), but you won't see the girl I used to be
'Cause she, she's so gone (She's so gone), away like history
She's so gone (She's so gone)

[Outro]
Baby, this is me
She's so gone, that's so over now
She's so gone, you won't find her around
You can look but you won't see the girl I used to be
'Cause (She's so gone), she's so gone
