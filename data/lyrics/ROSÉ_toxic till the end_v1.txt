[Verse 1]
Call us what we are, toxic from the start
Can't pretend that I was in the dark
When you met my friends, didn't even try with them
I should've known right then

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were jealous and possessive
So manipulatin'
Honestly, impressive
You had me participatin'

[Chorus]
Back then, when I was runnin' out of your place
I said, "I never wanna see your face"
I meant I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic till the end
Uh-huh, 'cause even when I said it was over
You heard, "Baby, can you pull me in closеr?"
You were plotting how to stay in my head
Wе were toxic till the end

[Interlude]
Ladies and gentlemen
I present to you
The ex

[Verse 2]
His favourite game is chess, who would ever guess?
Playing with the pieces in my chest
Now he's on the screen and saying, "Don't leave"
You stole that line from me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're just jealous and possessive
So manipulatin'
Honestly, impressive
You had me participatin'

[Chorus]
Back then, when I was runnin' out of your place
I said, "I never wanna see your face"
I meant I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic till the end
Uh-huh, 'cause even when I said it was over
You heard, "Baby, can you pull me in closer?"
You were plotting how to stay in my head
We were toxic till the end, end, end

[Bridge]
I can forgive you for a lot of things
For not giving me back my Tiffany rings
I'll never forgive you for one thing, my dear
You wasted my prettiest years

[Chorus]
Back then, when I was runnin' out of your place
I said, "I never wanna see your face"
I meant I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic
Uh-huh, 'cause even when I said it was over
You heard, "Baby, can you pull me in closer?"
You were plotting how to stay in my head
We were toxic till the end, end, end
We were toxic till the end, end, end
