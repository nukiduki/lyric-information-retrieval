[Verse 1]
Every time I take a ride
I feel alive with nowhere to go
I'm the king of the road
You're the queen of my throne
Riding high day and night
You're satisfied wherever we roam
You're the star of the show
You shimmer like gold

[Chorus]
Now baby let's ride
We got nothing but time
You get all the reaction
You're the main attraction
It's no surprise
God, I like your style
You're the perfect distraction
You're the main attraction

[Verse 2]
Roaming through the city like the track of time
The freedom is mine
Riding the lines
You know how I like it, yeah
Pedal to the metal, I'm your soldier
We can take it for miles
And let it unwind
Just how I like it

[Chorus]
Now baby let's ride
We got nothing but time
You get all the reaction
You're the main attraction
It's no surprise
God, I like your style
You're the perfect distraction
You're the main attraction

[Bridge]
Now baby let's ride
Now baby let's ride
Ooh I like your style
Yeah

[Chorus]
Now baby let's ride
We've got nothing but time
You get all the reaction
You're the main attraction
It's no surprise
God, I like your style
You're the perfect distraction
You're the main attraction
