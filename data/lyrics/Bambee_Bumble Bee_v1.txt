[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Sweet little bumble bee
I know what you want from me
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Sweet little bumble bee
More than just a fantasy
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da

[Verse 1]
My heart skips a beat
When you walk in the room
I go boom, boom, boom
You go zoom, zoom, zoom
You're my playboy, playtoy
Lover, my friend
I wanna be with you until the end

[Pre-Chorus]
I give my heart and my soul to you
To make you see it's true
I'm so confused, baby, can't you see?
Please come rescue me

[Chorus]
Sweet little bumble bee
I know what you want from me
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Sweet little bumble bee
More than just a fantasy
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da

[Verse 2]
I start to cry
When you walk out the door
You go, "Bye, bye, bye"
I go, "Why, why, why?"
I'm so lonely and only
Waitin' for you
To come back and tell me "I love you"

[Pre-Chorus]
I give my heart and my soul to you
To make you see it's true
I'm so confused, baby, can't you see?
Please come rescue me

[Chorus]
Sweet little bumble bee
I know what you want from me
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Sweet little bumble bee
More than just a fantasy
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da

[Bridge]
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da

[Chorus]
Sweet little bumble bee
I know what you want from me
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Sweet little bumble bee
More than just a fantasy
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-da-da
