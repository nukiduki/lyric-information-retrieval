[Verse 1: Baby Bugs]
Baby, I never lie
I'd do anything you ask and I wouldn't ask why
Baby, what's not to like?
Did I scare you off again? This time I'll do it right

[Chorus: Baby Bugs]
Baby, baby
Please don't hate me
You know I can't be alone, I fell so hard I broke my bones
And now you're sayin'
"Stop complainin'"
Do you like to watch me cry
To watch me break, to watch me die?

[Verse 2: Solya]
Baby, I'll never change
I tell you all my secrets and you tell me I'm insane
Baby, I'm terrified
Love me 'til you leave me then I'll know that I was right

[Chorus: Baby Bugs & Solya]
Baby, baby
Please don't hate mе
You know I can't be alone, I fell so hard I brokе my bones
And now you're sayin'
"Stop complainin'"
Do you like to watch me cry
To watch me break, to watch me die?

[Bridge: Baby Bugs & Solya]
You won't, you won't move on from this
You won't, you won't forget that I exist
You've got me, you've got me at your fingertips
No, I know, I know you won't move on from this
You've got me, you've got me at your fingertips

[Chorus: Baby Bugs, Baby Bugs & Solya]
Baby, baby
Please don't hate me
You know I can't be alone, I fell so hard I broke my bones
And now you're sayin'
"Stop complainin'"
Do you like to watch me cry
To watch me break, to watch me die?
