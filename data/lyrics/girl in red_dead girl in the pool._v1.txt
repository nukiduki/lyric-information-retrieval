[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Empty bottles everywhere
People sleeping on the stairs
Got something stuck in my hair
No idea how it got there

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the morning after
The house is such a disaster
But there's someone outside
That caught my eye

[Chorus]
There's a dead girl in the pool
There's a dead girl in the pool
There's a dead girl in the pool
I don't know what to do
I'm the dead girl in the pool
I'm the dead girl in the pool
I'm the dead girl in the pool

[Verse 2]
I can't stop staring at my face
My summer tan has begun to fade
Is this real or is this fake?
A creepy dream I can't escape

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the morning after
My mind is such a disaster
But there's someone outside
That caught my eye

[Chorus]
There's a dead girl in the pool
There's a dead girl in the pool
There's a dead girl in the pool
I don't know what to do
I'm the dead girl in the pool
I'm the dead girl in the pool
I'm the dead girl in the pool

[Bridge]
I'm the dead girl in the pool
What the fuck is going on?
I'm the dead girl in the pool, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the morning after
My mind is such a disaster
But there's someone outside
That caught my eye

[Chorus]
There's a dead girl in the pool
There's a dead girl in the pool
There's a dead girl in the pool
I'm the dead girl in the pool
I'm the dead girl in the pool
I'm the dead girl in the pool
