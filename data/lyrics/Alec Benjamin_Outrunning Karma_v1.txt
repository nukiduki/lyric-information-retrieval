[Verse 1]
Outrunning karma
That boy, he's such a charmer
All the bugs and their larva
Follow him out to Colorado
Ten dozen hearts in a bag
Their bodies lying
He'll drag them down to Colorado
A modern desperado

[Pre-Chorus]
And he'll race for miles through the night
He runs because he knows he cannot hide

[Chorus]
He's never gonna make it
All the poor people he's forsaken
Karma is always gonna chase him for his lies
It's just a game of waiting
From the church steeple down to Satan
Karma, there's really no escape until he dies

[Verse 2]
Outrunning karma
That boy can't run no farther
It's the last days of Sparta
Follow him down to meet Apollo

[Pre-Chorus]
And he'll brace for battle in the night
He'll fight because he knows he cannot hide

[Chorus]
He's never gonna make it
All the poor people he's forsaken
Karma is always gonna chase him for his lies
It's just a game of waiting
From the church steeple down to Satan
Karma, there's really no escape until he dies

[Bridge]
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la

[Chorus]
He's never gonna make it
All the poor people he's forsaken
Karma is always gonna chase him for his lies
It's just a game of waiting
From the church steeple down to Satan
Karma, there's really no escape until he dies

[Outro]
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la
