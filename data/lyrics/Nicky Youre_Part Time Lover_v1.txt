[Intro]
I don't wanna be a part time lover or your full time friend
Something for the summer that you just forget
Baby, I just want the kind of love that lasts for life
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
You know the movie
Where the guy gets the girl in the end
That could be you and me
If I said what I thought in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
It should be obvious to you
Just like it is to me
Do you want the real thing?
'Cause I don't think that I can pretend

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a part time lover or your full time friend
Something for the summer that you just forget
Baby, I just want the kind of lovе that lasts for life
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Post-Chorus]
I don't wanna be a part time lovеr in a crowded room
Holding someone else wishing it was you
Baby, I just want the kind of love that lasts for life
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
I like the way it feels
Waking up with your head on my heart (Head on my heart)
All of the fireworks
Can't you tell that we're more than a spark?

[Pre-Chorus]
It should be obvious to you
Just like it is to me
Don't take your light away
I don't wanna be left in the dark (Dark)

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a part time lover or your full time friend
Something for the summer that you just forget
Baby, I just want the kind of love that lasts for life
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Post-Chorus]
I don't wanna be a part time lover in a crowded room
Holding someone else wishing it was you
Baby, I just want the kind of love that lasts for life
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Outro]
I want it
Don't, don't you want it? (Yeah)
I want it
Don't, don't you want it too? (Baby)
I want it
Don't, don't you want it? (Yeah)
I want it
Don't, don't you want it too?
I want it
Don't, don't you want it (Don't you want it, baby?)
I want it
Don't, don't you want it too?
I want it
Don't, don't you want it?
