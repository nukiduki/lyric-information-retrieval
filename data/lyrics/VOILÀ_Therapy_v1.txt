[Verse 1]
Ring once, ring twice
Guess you're not picking up your phone
Hung out to dry

Ring three, ring four
Arguin' with your dial tone
Call back once more, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
We went from everything to nothing (In a night)
And I never saw it coming (Tell me why)
Why you couldn't leave me something
To hold at night

[Chorus]
Yeah, you messed me up when you cut me loose
Lost my mind with you
I'ma need some therapy
How did we go from being the perfect two
To strangers in a room?
I'ma need, I'ma need some therapy
Some therapy

[Verse 2]
Pictures got me
Scrolling through all the memories
It's too heavy

I never got closure
So I keep playing it over and over
I'm always stuck in a mood, oh, I hate that

[Pre-Chorus]
We went from everything to nothing (In a night)
And I never saw it coming (Tell me why)
Why you couldn't leave me something
To hold at night

[Chorus]
Yeah, you messed me up when you cut me loose
Lost my mind with you
I'ma need some therapy
How did we go from being the perfect two
To strangers in a room?
I'ma need, I'ma need some therapy
Some therapy

[Bridge]
Ring once, ring twice
Guess you're not picking up your phone

[Chorus]
Yeah, you messed me up when you cut me loose
Lost my mind with you
I'ma need some therapy
How did we go from being the perfect two
To strangers in a room?
I'ma need, I'ma need some therapy
Some therapy
Some therapy

[Outro]
Ring once, ring twice
Guess you're not picking up your phone
