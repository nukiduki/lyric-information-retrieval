[Verse 1]
Don't kill me, just help me run away
From everyone, I need a place to stay
Where I can cover up my face
Don't cry, I am just a freak

[Chorus]
I am just a freak
I am just a freak
I am just a freak

[Verse 2]
My head is filled with parasites
Black holes cover up my eyes
I dream of you almost every night
Hopefully, I won't wake up this time

[Chorus]
I won't wake up this time
I won't wake up this time
I won't wake up this time
