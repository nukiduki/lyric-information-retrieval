[Verse 1]
I guess the apple don't fall far from the tree
'Cause I've been looking at you so long
Now I only see me
I wanna throw the apple into the sky
Feels like you never understand me
So I just wanna drive
To the airport, the airport
The airport, the airport

[Verse 2]
I guess the apple could turn yellow or green
I know there's lots of different nuances
To you and to me
I wanna grow the apple, keep all the seeds
But I can't help but get so angry
You don't listen, I leave
To the airport, the airport
The airport, the airport
The airport, the airport
The airport, the airport

[Interlude]
(Yeah, yeah)
I'm gonna drive, gonna drive all night
I'm gonna drive, gonna drive all night

[Verse 3]
I think the apple's rotten right to the core
From all the things passed down
From all the apples coming before
I split the apple down symmetrical lines
And what I find is kinda scary
Makes me just wanna drive
(Drive, drive, drive, dr-dr-dr-drive, drive, drive)
(I'm gonna drive, gonna drive all night)
(I'm gonna drive, gonna drive all night)
(Drive, drive, drive, dr-dr-dr-drive, drive)

[Outro]
I wanna know where you go
When you're feeling alone
When you're feeling alone, do you?
I wanna know where you go
When you're feeling alone
When you're feeling alone, do you?
(Do you, do you, do you, do you)
(Do you, do you, do you, do you)
(Do you, do you, do you, do you)
(Do you, do you, do you, do you)
(Do you, do you, do you, do you)
(Do you, do you, do you, do you)
(Do you, do you, do you, do you)
(Do you, do you, do you, do you)
(Do you, do you)
