[Verse 1]
Hey, Bunny
Please grab that knife right there
Take it to the playground and the fair
Hey, Bunny
Don't you wanna rip off your fingernails?
Let the maggots feast while you rot in jail

[Chorus]
Hey, Bunny
What the hell is wrong with us?
I wanna scratch myself with infected rust
Hey, Bunny
What if I lose you too?
If we become one monster, together we can always be blue

[Verse 2]
Hey, Bunny
What's with those evil eyes?
Blood-shot and crying from pesticides
Hey, Bunny
Sorry to bother you
But I think if you'rе Bunny, then I'm Bunny too

[Chorus]
Hey, Bunny
What the hеll is wrong with us?
I wanna scratch myself with infected rust
Hey, Bunny
What if I lose you too?
If I become the monster, together we can always be blue

[Verse 3]
Hey, Bunny
Is that your name again?
It's making me laugh 'cause we used to be friends
Hey, Bunny
Am I talking in the mirror?
I only see myself as what we were

[Chorus]
Hey, Bunny
What the hell is wrong with us?
I wanna scratch myself with infected rust
Hey, Bunny
What if I lose you too?
If we become the monster, together we can always be blue

[Outro]
Hey, Bunny
What the hell is wrong with us?
I wanna scratch myself with infected rust
Hey, Bunny
What if I lose you too?
If we become the monster, together we can always be blue
