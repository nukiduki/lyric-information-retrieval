[Verse 1]
Bleedin'
First time we cut was the deepest
Miss all the lies and the secrets
Crave it, need it, I'm
Floatin'
Best when I'm lost in your ocean
I'm wet from all the emotion
So deep, oh shit

[Pre-Chorus]
Call it quits, pull the tourniquet
I'm a masochist, rip out my guts

[Chorus]
Won't you crush me under the weight of your body?
You know I put you above me, I wanna cry
When you fuck me, I want your kisses to cut me
Come on, I dare you to love me, wonderin' why
Won't you crush me?
Won't you crush me?

[Verse 2]
It's a circuit
Loopin' around like a circus
Push me around, put your tongue in my mouth
Take me back to the ground, baby, I ain't no virgin (Uh-uh)
I'm not really one that'll play it down
You're the only one that I think about, mm-mm

[Chorus]
I see heaven when you crush me under the weight of your body
You know I put you above me, I wanna cry
When you fuck me, I want your kisses to cut me
Come on, I dare you to love me, wonderin' why
Won't you crush me?
Oh, you crush me

[Post-Chorus]
Part of me wants forever
You're hard-wired in my brain
Part of me knows better
Maybe I'll listen someday
Part of me wants forever
You're hard-wired in my brain (Oh)
But part of me knows lettin' you go
Will crush me, crush me
