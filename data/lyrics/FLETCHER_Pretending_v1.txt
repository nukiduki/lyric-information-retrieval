[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
We're talking small, like, "How you been?"
Like, "How's your mom and all your friends?"
We're catching up about all the bullshit trending
You crack a joke 'bout kissin' me
'Bout going there, 'bout lovin' me
I laugh it off as if that shit wouldn't wreck me

[Chorus]
As if I'm not what you're waiting for
Like I'm not in your ending
Yeah, for now, we'll both keep on pretending
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah (Yeah, for now)
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah (We'll both keep on pretending)

[Verse 2]
You drop me off, your windows down
I'm lookin' in, you're lookin' out
I say goodnight as if my heart isn't wrenchin'
I'll say it now (I'll say it now), "You're everything" (You're everything)
"Turn back around, and never leave"
I typе it out as if that's the text I'm sending

[Chorus]
As if I'm not what you'rе waiting for
Like I'm not in your ending
Yeah, for now, we'll both keep on pretending
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah (Yeah, for now)
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah (We'll both keep on pretending)

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah (Keep on pretending)
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah (Keep on pretending)
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah (Keep on pretend, yeah, for now)
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah (We'll both keep on pretending)

[Bridge]
As if I'm not what you're waiting for
Like I'm not in your ending
Yeah, for now, we'll both keep on
Yeah, for now, we'll both keep on
Yeah, for now, we'll both keep on
Yeah, for now, we'll both keep on
Yeah, for now, we'll both keep on pretending

[Chorus]
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah (Yeah, for now)
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah (We'll both keep on pretending, now)

[Outro]
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah (Keep on pretending, pretending)
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah (Keep on pretend, pretending)
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah (Keep on pretending, yeah, for now)
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah (We'll both keep on pretending)
