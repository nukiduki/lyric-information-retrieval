[Verse 1]
I know sleep is friends with death
But maybe I should get some rest
'Cause I've been out here workin' all damn day
Blueberries and butterflies
The pretty things that greet my eyes
When you call and I say, "I'm on my way"
(One, two!)

[Chorus]
You and me belong together
Like cold iced tea and warmer weather
Where we lay out late underneath the pines
And we still have fun when thе sun won't shine
You and me belong togеther all the time

[Post-Chorus]
(Mm, mm, mm)
(Oh, woah, oh)

[Verse 2]
Spillin' wine and homemade drinks
We throw a cheers, the worries sink
Damnit, it's so good to be alive
We know that we don't got much
But, then again, it's just enough
To always find a way for a good time

[Chorus]
You and me belong together
Like cold iced tea and warmer weather
Where we lay out late underneath the pines
And we still have fun when the sun won't shine
You and me belong together

[Bridge]
This love is all we need
Oh, we've got so much
You and me, oh

[Chorus]
You and me belong together
Like cold iced tea and warmer weather
Where we lay out late underneath the pines
And we still have fun when the sun won't shine
You and me belong together all the time

[Outro]
It goes on and on and on (Hey)
It goes on and on and on (Ha-ha-ha)
It goes on and on and on (Woo)
