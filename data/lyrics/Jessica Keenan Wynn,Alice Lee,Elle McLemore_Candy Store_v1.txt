[H. CHANDLER, spoken]
Are we gonna have a problem?
You got a bone to pick?
You've come so far, why now are you pulling on my dick?
I'd normally slap your face off
And everyone here could watch
But I'm feeling nice, here's some advice
Listen up, biatch

[HEATHERS]
I like

[H. CHANDLER, H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
Lookin' hot, buying stuff they cannot
(I like) Drinkin' hard, maxin' Dad's credit card
(I like) Skippin' gym, scarin' her, screwin' him
(I like) Killer clothes

[HEATHERS]
Kickin' nerds in the nose

[H. CHANDLER, H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
If you lack the balls, you can go play dolls
Let your mommy fix you a snack
Woah
Or you could come smoke, pound some rum and coke
In my Porsche with the quarterback
Woah, woah, woah

[HEATHERS]
Honey, whatchu waitin' for?
Welcome to my candy store
Time for you to prove you're not a loser anymore
Then step into my candy store

[HEATHERS, H. DUKE, H. MCNAMARA, H. CHANDLER]
(Guys fall) At your feet, pay the check, help you cheat
(All you) Have to do: Say goodbye to Shamu
(That freak's) Not your friend, I can tell in the end
(If she) Had your shot, she would leave you to rot
[H. MCNAMARA]
'Course if you don't care, fine! Go braid her hair
Maybe Sesame Street is on

[H. CHANDLER & H. DUKE]
Woah

[H. MCNAMARA]
Or forget that creep

[H. DUKE]
And get in my Jeep

[H. CHANDLER]
Let's go tear up someone's lawn

[H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
Woah, woah, woah

[HEATHERS]
Honey, whatchu waitin' for?
Welcome to my candy store
You just gotta prove you're not a pussy anymore
Then step into my candy store

[H. CHANDLER, H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
You can join the team (Or you can bitch and moan)
You can live the dream (Or you can die alone)
You can fly with eagles
[HEATHERS]
Or if you prefer

[H. CHANDLER]
Keep on testing me

[HEATHERS]
And end up like her

[MARTHA, spoken]
Veronica, look! Ram invited me to his homecoming party
This proves he's been thinking about me

[VERONICA, spoken]
Color me stoked

[MARTHA, spoken]
I'm so happy

[H. DUKE, H. CHANDLER & H. MCNAMARA]
(Woah) Ooh-woah
Honey, whatchu waitin' foâ€”

[H. CHANDLER, spoken]
Shut up, Heather!

[H. CHANDLER, H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
Step into my candy store
Woah, time for you to prove you're not a lame-ass anymore
Oh-ohh

[HEATHERS]
Then step into my candy store
It's my candy store, it's my candy
It's my candy store, it's my candy
It's my candy store, it's my candy store
