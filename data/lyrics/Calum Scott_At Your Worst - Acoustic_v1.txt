[Intro]
You know I love you at your worst
Be right beside you when it hurts
Don't you know I would die for you?
The least that you deserve
You know I'll always put you first
Do anything to make it work
I would go anywhere for you
Across the universe

[Chorus]
I'd go all the way to love you
I'll be there when you say you need me
On the days when you don't believe me
I'll find all the ways to love you
And as long as my heart is beating
I'll be there with you, please, believe me
I love you at your worst

[Verse]
And I know sometimes the days get heavy
And I know sometimes that life can get you down
But I promise I'll be right beside you

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I love you at your worst
Be right beside you when it hurts
Don't you know I would die for you?
The least that you deserve

[Chorus]
I'd go all the way to love you
I'll be there when you say you need me
On the days when you don't believe me
I'll find all the ways to love you
And as long as my heart is beating
I'll be there with you, please, believe me
You know I love you at your worst

[Outro]
The least that you deserve
Don't you know I would die for you?
You know I love you at your worst
