Verse 1:
I was frozen by the city lights
I was young and cold and terrified
Told my mom "I'm on my way back home to you"
Ooh

Chorus:
She said "slow down"
You're running out of road boy
You better look around
You've been a little lost
But I know that you'll be right where you wanna be
Before you know it
And you don't wanna miss a thing
Going up, up and away
Up, up and away

Verse 2:
When we were kids we'd cast away the toys
Oh we were dumb and drunk and paranoid
Told my mom "I'm on my way back home to you"
Ooh

Chorus:
She said "slow down"
You're running out of road boy
You better look around
You've been a little lost
But I know that you'll be right where you wanna be
Before you know it
And you don't wanna miss a thing
Going up, up and away
Up, up and away

Bridge:
Call me call me
When you need me
I'll be there for you
But in the meantime
Keep your head high
We were lost like you
Call me call me
When you need me
I'll be there for you
But in the meantime
Keep your head high
We were lost like you

Chorus:
She said slow down
You're running out of road boy
You better look around
You've been a little lost
But I know that you'll be right where you wanna be
Before you know it
And you don't wanna miss a thing
Going up, up and away
Up, up and away
