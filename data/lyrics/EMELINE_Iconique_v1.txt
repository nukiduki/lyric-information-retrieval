[Intro]
I am many women
And they make all of me
And every part of them is
Iconique

[Pre-Chorus]
I am more than one thing or the other
Capable, insatiable, a wonder
If you take offense, then take a number and see

[Chorus]
Un, deux, trois
I'm Iconique
Iconique
A Madonna in the streets
And I'm Nirvana in the sheets
Iconique
I'm super freak
I'm synonymous with chic
Ooh, that's just me
You can't compete
Iconique

[Post-Chorus]
(Iconic) Mmm
(Iconic) Mmm
Mmm

[Verse]
Romanticize you fantasize
Of how you want to be with me
And every way to be like me
Vandalize, rules don't apply
It's fine 'cause I'm mine
And I don't waste my time

[Pre-Chorus]
I am more than one thing or the other
Capable, insatiable, a wonder
If you take offense, then take a number and see

[Chorus]
Un, deux, trois
I'm Iconique (Iconique)
Iconique (Iconique)
A Madonna in the streets
And I'm Nirvana in the sheets
Iconique
I'm super freak (I'm super, super)
I'm synonymous with chic
Ooh, that's just me
You can't compete
Iconique

[Post-Chorus]
(Iconic) Mmm
(You can't compete, bitch)
(Iconic) Mmm
Mmm
Iconique

[Bridge]
I can be your beauty, baby, I can be your beast
I-C-O-N-I-Q-U-E
Je pourrais être ta beauté, bébé
Je pourrais être ta bète
I-C-O-N-I-Q-U-E

[Chorus]
Un, deux, trois
I'm Iconique (Iconique)
Iconique (Iconique)
A Madonna in the streets
And I'm Nirvana in the sheets
Iconique
I'm super freak (I'm super, super)
I'm synonymous with chic
Ooh, that's just me
You can't compete
Iconique

[Post-Chorus]
(Iconic) Mmm
(Iconic) Mmm
(You can't compete, bitch)
Mmm
Iconique
(Iconic) Mmm
(Iconic) Mmm
Mmm
(Iconic)
