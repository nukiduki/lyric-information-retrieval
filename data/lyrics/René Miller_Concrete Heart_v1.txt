[Verse 1]
I remember staying up all night
Talking dreams and aspirations under midnight skies, oh yeah
You would tell me everything on your mind
And I would put my arms around you
Say that I'll be there for you
I recall only two weeks ago
You were saying it's so perfect when it's just me and you, oh yeah
Now there's a thousand people asking to know
About what happened but I don't even know myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm calling out from six feet down
As I'm left out in the cold
'Cause we called it love, was it just too much, my love?

[Chorus]
I hate the way you built me up to knock me down
Lined me up and shot me, left me on the ground
I heard that someone else is buried in your arms
I hate the way you pick me up to pull me apart
You loved me not, you loved me with a concrete heart
But I'm still holding on with nothing in these arms
'Cause you loved me with a concrete heart

[Verse 2]
Are you still wearing that old sweater of mine?
Are you still thinking about the words you said when you said goodbye?
Oh yeah
I guess "I love you" was your favorite lie
Or did you mean it when you said it, and then changed you mind

[Pre Chorus]
I'm calling out from six feet down
As I'm left out in the cold
Have you called it love, have you gone too far, my love?

[Chorus]
I hate the way you built me up to knock me down
Lined me up and shot me, left me on the ground
I heard that someone else is buried in your arms
I hate the way you pick me up to pull me apart
You loved me not, you loved me with a concrete heart
But I'm still holding on with nothing in these arms
'Cause you loved me with a concrete heart

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, with a concrete heart
Now I'm holding on with nothing in these arms

[Bridge]
We called it love, was it just too much, my love?
I hate the way you built me up to knock me down
Shot me, left me on the ground
I heard that someone else is buried in your arms

[Chorus]
I hate the way you pick me up to pull me apart
You loved me not, you loved me with a concrete heart
But I'm still holding on with nothing in these arms
'Cause you loved me with a concrete heart

[Outro]
'Cause you loved me with a concrete heart
