[Intro: Ricky Montgomery]
Only in my darkest moments can I see the light
I think I'm prone to getting blinded when it's bright
Well, this December, I'll remember
Want you to see it when I do, ooh
God knows I do

[Verse 1: Ricky Montgomery]
Only in my darkest moments can I see the light
I think I'm prone to getting blinded when it's bright
Well, this December, I'll remember
Want you to see it when I do, ooh
God knows I do

[Chorus: Ricky Montgomery]
I'm alright if you're alright
And I'm okay if you're okay
It's this state in this state I'm living in
It's just a little bit, it's just a little bit
Lonely in this home, it's always colder on your own
My darlin', I, I let the season change my mind
Hey!

[Verse 2: Noah Floersch, Ricky Montgomery & Noah Floersch]
Only in my darkest moments
Is there ever any spark of hope
That I can make it through another year?
So close to the end, do it over again
Well, this December, I'll remember
Want you to see it when I do, ooh
God knows I do

[Chorus: Ricky Montgomery, Noah Floersch, Ricky Montgomery & Noah Floersch]
Well, I'm alright if you're alright (I'm alright if you're alright, if I'm alright)
And I'm okay if you're okay (I'm okay if you're okay, if I'm okay it's just a)
It's this state in this state I'm living in (It's just this state, it's just this state, it's just this state I'm living in)
It's just a little bit, (it's just a little bit) it's just a little bit
(Aah ooh) Lonely in this home, it's always colder on your own (ooh)
My darlin', I, I let the season change my mind

[Bridge: Ricky Montgomery, Noah Floersch]
I'm alright if you're alright (I'm alright if you're alright, if I'm alright)
And I'm okay if you're okay (I'm okay if you're okay, if I'm okay it's just a)
It's this state in this state I'm living in (It's just this state, it's just this state, it's just this state I'm living in)
It's just a little bit, (it's just a little bit) it's just a little bit
This December, (This December) I'll remember (Yeah, I'll remember)
Want you to see it when I do, ooh (when I do, ooh)
God knows I do

[Outro: Ricky Montgomery, Noah Floersch, Ricky Montgomery & Noah Floersch]
I'm alright if you're alright
I'm okay if you're okay
It's this state, in this state I'm living in
This December, (This December) I'll remember (I'll remember)
Want you to see it when I do, ooh
God knows I do
