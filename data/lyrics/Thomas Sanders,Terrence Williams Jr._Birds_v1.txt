[Verse 1]
I don't wanna drive a fancy car today
I don't wanna ride in a red corvette
I don't wanna jog my Saturday away
But I don't wanna go home yet

Today is not the day to jump out of a plane
I don't wanna parasail or play roulette
I don't wanna risk it all or go insane
But I don't wanna go home yet

[Chorus]
I just want to watch the birds go by
From my handy fold-able blue canvas throne
I wanna watch them fly and fly
And see them soar up into the unknown
But I'd feel just like a nerd
Watching birds
Watching me here all alone

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna break dance or learn tae-kwon-do
I don't wanna fish 'til all the fish are gone
I don't wanna roller skate, even if it's slow
I don't wanna pass out in a marathon

I don't like soccer, baseball track or field
I'm not up for a match of polo
I don't wanna seek or try to stay concealed
I'm also not up for... water polo?

[Chorus]
I just wanna watch the birds up there
Track the migratory patterns that they flow
I wanna watch them from my chair
With my binoculars, my latte and my phone
Trying to spot a lark
In the park
Parked in nature all alone

[Bridge]
Alone here with the doves
The sparrows, the ospreys
The owlets, the eaglets, and my list

It's just me and Mr. Finch
The robins, the kingfishers, the snipes
Though I heard they don't exist!

Each little species
And it's little way can teach me
What awaits you
If you can get away
I wanna watch the birds do what they will
Sorry if I'm ornithologically prone
I wanna watch from somewhere undisturbing
Quiet, calm, still
Sit right here and gaze at the unknown

I don't wanna fly in the sky, I just wanna be alone

(spoken)
It's not a big deal, or anything

(sung)
I just wanna be alone
