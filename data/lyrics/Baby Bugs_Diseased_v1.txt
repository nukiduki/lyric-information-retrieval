[Verse 1]
In this cage again
They ask me how I've been
I'll smile big, try to pretend
I'm not being tortured by them
Why can't they just decide?
They want me dead and alive
Don't you think I've fucking tried
To mend the wounds I have inside?

[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
They can't fix me
I have always been diseased
I feel it underneath my skin
But I'm too scared to bleed
No, they can't fix me
I am sick terminally
I think that worms and rats are living
Where my brain used to be

[Verse 2]
Tried to get me brainwashеd
Said this was the cost
Of questioning, of being lost
But now I'll gеt my point across
Never trust a soul
That says they'll make you whole
I love being empty and cold
Don't remember a thing I’m told

[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
They can't fix me
I have always been diseased
I feel it underneath my skin
But I'm too scared to bleed
No, they can't fix me
I am sick terminally
I think that worms and rats are living
Where my brain used to be

[Bridge]
Taking over me
Feel myself crumbling
But don't try anything
No, don't tie up my wings
What did I fucking do
To think I deserve you
And what you put me through?
Do what you wanna do

[Chorus]
They can't fix me
I have always been diseased
I feel it underneath my skin
But I'm too scared to bleed
They can't fix me, I am sick terminally
I think that worms and rats are living
Where my brain used to be
