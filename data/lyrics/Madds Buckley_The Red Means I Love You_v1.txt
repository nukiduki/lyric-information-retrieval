[Verse 1]
Unusual
They say strange fascination, infatuation
A lunatic
Call me what suits your taste, I just wanna taste
And I've always heard it's what's inside that counts

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause my insides are red, and yours are too
And the red on my face is matching you
And goodness, you're bleeding, what a wonderful feeling
You're down, and you're pleading, my head is just reeling

[Chorus]
The red means I love you
Tasting your blood means I love you
The red means I love you
The red means I love you

[Verse 2]
Unfortunate
They say such a shame, I turned out this way
A maniac
Well, yеah, I get manic when I cause a panic
And of coursе I'm excited when I see you around

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause my insides are red, and yours are too
And the red on my face is matching you
And goodness, you're bleeding, what a wonderful feeling
You're down and you're pleading, my head is just reeling

[Chorus]
The red means I love you
Tasting your blood means I love you
The red means I love you
The red means I love you

[Bridge]
You leave me high and dry
A rush comes to my mind
At the drops of blood you leave behind
Run as you might, my love will never, ever
Stop
And I've always heard it's what's inside

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause my insides are red, and yours are too
And the red on my face is matching you
And goodness, you're bleeding, what a wonderful feeling
You're down, and you're pleading, my head is just reeling

[Chorus]
The red means I love you
Tasting your blood means I love you
The red means I love you
The red means I love you
The red means I love you
Tasting your blood means I love you
The red means I love you
The red means I love you
