[Chorus]
She, queen of the kings
Runnin' so fast, beatin' the wind
Nothin' in this world could stop the spread of her wings
She, queen of the kings
Broken her cage, threw out the keys
She will be the warrior of North and Southern Seas

[Verse 1]
Got raven hair, it's dark as night
Icy eyes, out of sight, out of sight
Her heart in spite, is warm and bright
Her smile awakes the Northern Light

[Pre-Chorus]
Lookin' out she calls
Lai, lai-da-dai-dai-da
Who will conquer all, all?

[Chorus]
Her name is she, queen of the kings
Runnin' so fast, beatin' the wind
Nothin' in this world could stop the spread of her wings (Hеy!)
She, queen of the kings
Broken hеr cage, threw out the keys
She will be the warrior of North and Southern Seas

[Verse 2]
A firestone forged in flames
The wildest card, run the game, run the game
Can't stay the same in this world of change
Don't fear the pain, just break the chain

[Pre-Chorus]
Lookin' out she calls
Lai, lai-da-dai-dai-da
Who will conquer all, all?

[Chorus]
Her name is she, queen of the kings
Runnin' so fast, beatin' the wind (Hey!)
Nothin' in this world could stop the spread of her wings
She, queen of the kings
Broken her cage, threw out the keys (Hey!)
She will be the warrior of North and Southern Seas

[Bridge]
Lai, la-da-dia
Ra, rai-ri-rai-rai-ri
Lai, la-da-dia
Lai, li-li-la
Lai, la-da-dia
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
Ah-ah-ah-ah

[Chorus]
Her name is she, queen of the kings
Runnin' so fast, beatin' the wind (Hey!)
Nothin' in this world could stop the spread of her wings
She, queen of the kings
Broken her cage, threw out the keys (Hey!)
She will be the warrior of North and Southern Seas (Hey!)
