[Chorus]
Was it all in my head?
Was it meant to be?
Thought I'd love you 'til death
Now you're dead to me
I hate you, hate you, hate you
What did you do this to me?
Thought I'd love you 'til death
Now you're dead to me

[Verse 1]
Did you mean when you said that you would love me til the end of time?
Or are you just that comfortable at lying?
We charm for a living, yeah
We make people see what they wanna see
Is that how it was with me?
Up against your car
Telling me what I want to hear
Me and you forever baby
Someone gеt me out of here
Thank you for thе courtesy call to tell me that after all we went through you chose her

[Chorus]
Was it all in my head?
Was it meant to be?
Thought I'd love you 'til death
Now you're dead to me
Was it all in my head?
Was it meant to be?
Thought I'd love you til death
Now you're dead to me
I hate you, hate you, hate you
Why did you do this to me?
Thought I'd love you til death
Now you're dead to me

[Verse 2]
How did it feel to see me crumble like I did in the palm of your hand?
Did it make you feel like a man?
If that could solve all your problems
But every night after arguing
You come running back to me
It’s kinda crazy looking back on the games you played
Grass ain’t always greener
Baby look at the mess you made
Thank you for the memories of what I thought was love
When really it was a bad dream

[Chorus]
Was it all in my head?
Was it meant to be?
Thought I'd love you til death
Now you're dead to me
I hate you, hate you, hate you
Why did you to this do me?
Thought I'd love you til death
Now you're dead to me
Thought I'd love you til death
Now you're dead to me
