[Verse 1]
I know you don't like it when we chime in
Think we're done with your shit this time
You feed upon the lies if I analyze it
You're regurgitating every line
You must be feeling kinda lonely
So sick of thinking that you know me
I know you don't like it when I don't quit (Kinda love it)

[Bridge]
But I kinda love it
Yeah, I kinda love it
And yeah, I kinda love it
(Kinda love it)

[Verse 2]
I know you don't like it when we're thriving
You should pick another hill to climb
Why you hearing violence in our silence?
You're the one who's burning picket signs
You must bе feeling kinda lonely (You must be feeling kinda lonely)
What makеs you think you fucking know me?
I know you don't like it but we won't quit
And I kinda love it

[Outro]
Yeah, I love it when you save me
Love it when you act like you don't hate me
I've been naughty, misbehaving
Turned myself into the wicked and depraved kid, yeah
You've been fighting the offence for a quick minute
I'll knock some sense into your head and have you sit with it
Yeah, I love it when you save me, just save me
And yeah, we kinda love it
Yeah, I love it when you save me, just save me
And yeah, we kinda love it
