[Verse 1]
Avada Kedavra, I speak to destroy
The feelings I have, I cannot avoid
Through twisted tongues, a hex deployed on you
That all the pretties in your bed
Escape your hands and make you sad
And all the things you wish you had, you lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I
I know you're living a lie
I, I
I see the scars in your eyes
I, I
I know you're living a lie
I, I

[Chorus]
I guess you'd rather have a star than the Moon
I guess I always overestimate you
Hoodoo all the things that you do
I'm down, down in my doomsday blues

[Post-Chorus]
I, I
I know you're living a lie
I, I
I know you're living a lie

[Verse 2]
Avada Kedavra, the thoughts in my head
Thе places I touch when lying in bed
Thе visions of you, the words that you said, undo
My heartbeat buried in the ground
And to the strings I bind, you're bound
So when you sleep you'll hear the sound (Cuckoo)

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I
I know you're living a lie
I, I
I see the scars in your eyes
I, I
I know you're living a lie
I, I

[Chorus]
I guess you'd rather have a star than the Moon
I guess I always overestimate you
Hoodoo all the things that you do
I'm down, down in my doomsday blues
I guess you'd rather have a star than the Moon
I guess I always overestimate you
Hoodoo all the things that you do
I'm down, down in my doomsday blues

[Bridge]
For your romance I'd beg, steal and borrow
It's draining me hollow, you (I guess you'd rather have a star than the Moon)
You could slow dance me out of my sorrow (I guess you'd rather have a star than the Moon)
But your favourite colour compared to the others is doom
Doomsday blue

[Outro]
Blue (Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue)
Blue (Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue)
Blue, blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue, blue
Avada Kedavra, I speak to destroy
