[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
If I were you, I would be more confident
You're lucky that you're pretty
Why are you obsessed
With your appearance?
I don't wanna hear it, you're fine
It's been my best-kept secret for a while now
No one ever sees it, but it's all around

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the dinner conversation no one talks about
Don't know how much longer I can keep this down

[Chorus]
Beauty is a knife
I've been holding by the blade
Swallowing my pride so I won't eat anything
It's all a lie, honestly, it's eating me alive
They're all like
"Did you change your hair?"
"Did you lose a little weight?"
"You should keep it up 'cause it really looks great"
I hate that I always look my best
When I'm dying on the inside
When I'm dying on the inside

[Verse 2]
I wish I could break the mirror
It makes me feel like I should fucking disappear
And drown my demons in a bathtub filled with tears
No matter what I try, they always seem to come back to life
What if I didn't do this to my body?
What if I quit and then you don't want me?

[Pre-Chorus]
The dinner conversation no one talks about
Don't know how much longer I can keep this down

[Chorus]
Beauty is a knife
I've been holding by the blade
Swallowing my pride so I won't eat anything
It's all a lie, honestly, it's eating me alive
They're all like
"Did you change your hair?"
"Did you lose a little weight?"
"You should keep it up 'cause it really looks great"
I hate that I always look my best
When I'm dying on the inside
When I'm dying on the inside
When I'm dying on the inside

[Bridge]
You should take it as a compliment
If I were you, I would be more confident
You're lucky that you're pretty
Why are you obsessed with your appearance?
I don't wanna hear it, you're fine

[Chorus]
Beauty is a knife
I've been holding by the blade
Swallowing my pride so I won't eat anything
It's all a lie, honestly, it's eating me alive
They're all like
"Did you change your hair?"
"Did you lose a little weight?"
"You should keep it up 'cause it really looks great"
I hate that I always look my best
When I'm dying on the inside
