[Verse 1]
Hey, you don't like the way I'm talking
Hey, so you stand there keep on callin' me names
No, I'm not your enemy so
If you're gonna do it, don't do it
Hey, do you wanna check my DNA?

And believe in fairytales, oh
(If you're gonna do it)

[Chorus]
I'm gonna stand here like a unicorn

I'm gonna stand here like a unicorn
Out here on my own
I got the power of a unicorn
Don't you ever learn?
That I won't look back, I won't look down
I'm going up, you better turn around
The power of a unicorn, the power of a unicorn

[Refrain]
It's gonna be phenomen-phenomen-phenomenal
Phenomen-phenomenal
אנ'לא כמו כולם, מול כל העולם, לא
It's gonna be phenomen-phenomen-phenomenal
Phenomen-phenomenal
You can call me queen, אין לי דאווין, לא

[Outro]
(It's gonna be, hey!)
(It's gonna be, hey!)
U-ni-corn!
U-ni-corn!
U-ni-corn!
U-ni-corn!
I'm standing like a—
