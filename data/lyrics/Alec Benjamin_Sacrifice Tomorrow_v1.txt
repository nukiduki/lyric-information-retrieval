[Verse 1]
If I could cut these seconds into pieces
I'd find a place for us to hide
In between the twos and threes
If I could stop the hands of time

[Pre-Chorus]
I would stay with you forever
But I should probably get some sleep
Then I walked over to the dresser
But as I went to grab my keys

[Chorus]
She said, "Let's sacrifice tomorrow for tonight
Never mind your obligations, please just stay here by my side"
She said, "Just give in to temptation, it's alright
I've got clothes that you can borrow, so let's sacrifice tomorrow"

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-ooh
Oh-ooh, mm

[Verse 2]
Cut the Earth's crust into piecеs
I'd make a beach for you and I
Make this dеsert a retreat
And we'd never have to say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
I would stay with you forever
But I should probably get some sleep
Then I walked over to the dresser
But as I went to grab my keys

[Chorus]
She said, "Let's sacrifice tomorrow for tonight
Never mind your obligations, please just stay here by my side"
She said, "Just give in to temptation, it's alright
I've got clothes that you can borrow, so let's sacrifice tomorrow"

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-ooh
Oh-ooh, mm

[Bridge]
Yeah, we can sleep all day
So, baby, please don't go
Don't sacrifice tonight
Tonight for tomorrow
Yeah, we can sleep all day
So, baby, please don't go
Don't sacrifice tonight
Tonight for tomorrow

[Chorus]
She said, "Let's sacrifice tomorrow for tonight
Never mind your obligations, please just stay here by my side"
She said, "Just give in to temptation, it's alright
I've got clothes that you can borrow, so let's sacrifice tomorrow"

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-ooh
Oh-ooh, mm
Oh-ooh
Oh-ooh, mm

[Outro]
Oh-ooh, mm
