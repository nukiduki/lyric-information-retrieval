[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, hey, lover
You don't have to be a star
Hey, hey, hey, lover
I love you just the way you are
For love is just the same
Without fortune or fame
Just give me
True love and understanding
True love and understanding

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, hey, lover
You don't have to be a king
Hey, hey, hey, lover
You don't have to have a thing
For I'll be satisfied
'Long as you are my guy
Just give me
True love and understanding
True love and understanding
For the rest of my days

[Bridge]
But, you won't have to worry
Life's a problem in my hands
But if you really, really love me
In my heart, you'll be a big man

[Chorus]
Hey lover, won't you treat me right?
And be with me tonight?
Just give me
True love and understanding
True love and understanding
For the rest of my days

[Spoken]
But you won't have to worry
Life's a problem in my hands
But if you really, really love me
In my heart, you'll be a big man

[Chorus]
Hey lover, won't you treat me right?
And be with me tonight?
Just give me
True love and understanding
True love and understanding
