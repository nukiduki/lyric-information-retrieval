[Verse 1]
I wake up, puttin' makeup on a sad face
And Listerine ain't fixing this bad taste in my mouth
Someone saw you out on Friday, saw you walking sideways
Guess you're gettin' fucked real good now

[Pre-Chorus]
Fine, okay, I'll say, I went and stalked her
And I don't really blame you 'cause
Damn, the waist (The waist), the hips (The hips), the face, this is awkward (Ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
Are you in love like we were?
If I were you, I'd probably keep her
Makes me wanna hit her when I see her
'Cause Becky's so hot in your vintage t-shirt
Ooh, she's the one I should hate
But I wanna know how she tastes
I kinda wanna hit her when I see her
Becky's so hot in your vintage t-shirt

[Verse 2]
I used to wear it too, yeah, it's the cropped one
With the red Corvette, someone new riding shotgun
I can't even be that mad about it, she flame emoji, wow
It's always gonna fuck me up 'cause

[Pre-Chorus]
Fine, okay, I'll say, I went and stalked her
And I don't really blame you 'cause
Damn, the waist (The waist), the hips (The hips), the face, this is awkward (Ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
Are you in love like we were?
If I were you, I'd probably keep her
Makes me wanna hit her when I see her
'Cause Becky's so hot in your vintage t-shirt
Ooh, she's the one I should hate
But I wanna know how she tastes
I kinda wanna hit her when I see her
Becky's so hot in your vintage t-shirt

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Becky's so hot, hot
Becky's so hot
Becky's so hot, hot
Becky's so hot

[Chorus]
Are you in love like we were? (Are you in love like we were?)
If I were you, I'd probably keep her (Probably keep her)
Makes me wanna hit her when I see her ('Cause Becky's so hot)
'Cause Becky's so hot in your vintage t-shirt
Ooh, she the one I should hate (She's the one)
But I wanna know how she tastes (How she tastes)
I kinda wanna hit it when I see her
Becky's so hot in your vintage t-shirt
