[Chorus]
Off with your head
Dance 'til you're dead
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
On the floor

[Verse 1]
Glitter on the wet streets
Silver over everything
The river's all wet
You're all chrome
Dripping with alchemy
Shiver, stop shivering
The glitter's all wet
You're all chrome

[Pre-Chorus]
The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, oh no
The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, oh no
Oh, ah
Oh, ah

[Chorus]
Off, off with your head
Dance, dance 'til you're dead (Dead)
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
On the floor

[Bridge]
Looking glass
Take the past
Shut your eyes
Mirror lies
Looking glass
Take the past
Shut your eyes
Mirror lies

[Verse 2]
Glitter on the wet streets
Silver over everything
The glitter's all wet
You're all chrome
You're all chrome
Oh, ah
Oh, ah

[Chorus]
Off, off, off with your head
Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead
Off, off, off with your head
Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead
Off, off, off with your head
Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead
Off, off, off with your head
Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead
Off, off, off with your head
Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead
Off, off, off with your head
Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead
