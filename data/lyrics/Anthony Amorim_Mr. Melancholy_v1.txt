I know a boy, he's sad as can be

He hates showing affection

But he likes it from me

We've got a great connection, not to mention his complexion, and his name is Mr. Melancholy

I know a boy, he's afraid of love

But when he pulls me closer, then that's more than enough

To show me how he's feeling cause his kiss is so revealin, but he hates all of that sensitive stuff

(Chorus)

I don't know exactly what it is about him

He could cry all day

I'd still wanna stay

Cause I know that I don't wanna be without him

All his gloomy skies

Wanna make 'em mine

Oh-woah

He flinches when I call him darling

Oh-woah

So I call him Mr. Melancholy

I know a boy

He's cool as they come

But if I tell him that I love him, I'm afraid that he'll run

Cause love is an expression that he hasn't quite collected but that's what makes it all kinda fun

And I know a boy, I like him a lot

'Cause when I feel like shit he lets me know that I'm not

And when I have some problems he is there to help me solve them even though he knows how many I've got

(Chorus)

I don't know exactly what it is about him

He could cry all day

I'd still wanna stay

Cause I know that I don't wanna be without him

All his gloomy skies

Wanna make 'em mine

Oh-woah

He flinches when I call him darling

Oh-woah

So I call him Mr. Melancholy

I know a boy

I want him to stay

'Cause with his gloomy skies

I've never had brighter days

I know it sounds insane but when I'm dancing in his rain I swear there's not a single thing I would change

(Chorus)

I don't know exactly what it is about him

He could cry all day

I'd still wanna stay

Cause I know that I don't wanna be without him

All his gloomy skies

Wanna make 'em mine

Oh-woah

He flinches when I call him darling

Oh-woah

So I call him Mr. Melancholy
