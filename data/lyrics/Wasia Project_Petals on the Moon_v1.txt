[Verse 1]
Feeling down
Orange juice
Cigarette
To get me through
As it rains
I conclude
I need help
From someone new

[Pre-Chorus]
So take me in your spaceship
Throw me up into new places
Blast me into silence
Let your guidance get me through this
Gravity is pulling me
Along and I can't find a way
To understand
Why I'm here again and again, oh

[Chorus]
I feel like everybody's singing out of tune
I feel like I can't help but always be so blue
But in the end I know I must keep pulling through
And brace myself for all the hell-likе petals on the moon

[Verse 2]
Feeling cold
Train delayеd
You've gone home
And I'm afraid
Helios
Sun divine
Hold me up
Into the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
You take me in your spaceship
Throw me up to constellations
Blast me into silence
Let your guidance get me through this
Gravity is pulling me
Along and I can't find a way
To understand
Why I'm here again and again, oh

[Chorus]
I feel like everybody's singing out of tune (I feel so blue)
I feel like I can't help but always be so blue (Keep pulling through)
But in the end I know I must keep pulling through
And brace myself for all the hell-like petals on the moon

[Bridge]
Born again, alone again, again
Home again, you're gone again, again, again
Will somebody be there for me when all my friends have left?
Even if I'm undone in the end, ooh

[Chorus]
I feel like everybody's singing out of tune (I feel so blue)
I feel like I can't help but always be so blue (Keep pulling through)
But in the end I know I must keep pulling through
And brace myself for all the hell-like petals on the moon
