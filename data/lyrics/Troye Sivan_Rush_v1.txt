[Intro]
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch

[Verse 1]
Big communication, tell me what you want
Translate your vibration, let your body talk to me
Baby love, if you wanna show me what
You've been schemin' up, if you wanna (Let go)
Trust the simulation, don't you let it break
Every stimulation, promise I can take
What you wanna give? Boy, you better show me what
You've been schemin' up

[Pre-Chorus]
You got my heartbeat racin'
My body blazin'

[Chorus]
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good

[Post-Chorus]
So good when we slow gravity, so good
It's so good, it's so good
Breathe one, two, three, take all of me, so good
It's so good, it's so good

[Verse 2]
Pass your boy the heatwave, recreate the sun
Take me to the feeling, boy, you know the one
Kiss it when you're done, man, this shit is so much fun
Pocket rocket gun

[Pre-Chorus]
You got my heartbeat (Heartbeat) racin' (Racin')
My body blazin'

[Chorus]
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good

[Post-Chorus]
So good when we slow gravity, so good
It's so good, it's so good
Breathe one, two, three, take all of me, so good
It's so good, it's so good

[Outro]
It's so good, it's so good
It's so good, it's so good
