[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Your blades are sharpened with precision
Flashing your favorite point of view
I know you're waiting in the distance
Just like you always do, just like you always do

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Already pulling me in
Already under my skin
And I know exactly how this ends, I

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Let you cut me open just to watch me bleed
Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
Don't know why I'm hopin' for what I won't receive
Fallin' for the promise of the emptiness machine
The emptiness machine

[Verse 2: Emily Armstrong, Emily Armstrong & Mike Shinoda]
Goin' around like a revolver
It's been decided how we lose
'Cause there's a fire under the altar
I keep on lyin' to, I keep on lyin' to

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Emily Armstrong]
Already pulling me in
Already under my skin
And I know exactly how this ends, I

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Let you cut me open just to watch me bleed
Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
Don't know why I'm hopin' for what I won't receive
Fallin' for the promise of the emptiness machine

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda, Emily Armstrong & Mike Shinoda]
I only wanted to be part of something
I only wanted to be part of, part of
I only wanted to be part of something
I only wanted to be part of, part of
I only wanted to be part of something
I only wanted to be part

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
I let you cut me open just to watch me bleed
Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
Don't know why I'm hopin', so fuckin' naive
Fallin' for the promise of the emptiness machine
The emptiness machine

[Outro: Emily Armstrong & Mike Shinoda]
(I only wanted to be part of something)
The emptiness machine, oh
(I only wanted to be part of)
The emptiness machine
