[Intro]
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty devil (Hey)
You pretty devil (Hey)

[Verse 1]
Pretty devil, you got it all
Moving elegant like a criminal
Captivated by how you walk
Irresistible, I'm in devil's awe

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be scared to step into the fire
You got the power

[Chorus]
Show off (I love it)
The way you let your body do the talk (I love it)
So, baby, I'ma never get enough (I love it)
Oh my God, you're such a rebеl
You pretty devil
Oh, baby, you're a
Prеtty, pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty devil (Hey)
You pretty devil
Oh, baby, you're a
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty devil (Hey)
You pretty devil (Hey)

[Verse 2]
Got me questioning my innocence
When you're walking in, makes me wanna sin
Oh, I love what you do to me
My protagonist, angel's enemy

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be scared to step into the fire
You got the power

[Chorus]
Show off (I love it)
The way you let your body do the talk (I love it)
So, baby, I'ma never get enough (I love it)
Oh my God, you're such a rebel
You pretty devil
Oh, baby, you're a
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty devil (Hey)
You pretty devil
Oh, baby, you're a
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty devil (Hey)
You pretty devil (Hey)

[Bridge]
So, baby, go, be divine, you're designed
To be a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
Oh, such a crime
How you lying, shying, hiding

[Chorus]
You gotta show off (I love it)
The way you let your body do the talk (I love it)
So, baby, I'ma never get enough (I love it)
Oh my God, you're such a rebel
You pretty devil
Oh, baby, you're a
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty devil (Hey)
You pretty devil
Oh, baby, you're a
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty devil (Hey)
You pretty devil
