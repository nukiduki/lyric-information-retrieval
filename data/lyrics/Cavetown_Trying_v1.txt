[Verse 1]
I'm not really sure if my words make sense to you
But I can't really find
Any other way to form these feelings into cubes
And sort them in my mind
The negative thoughts go on the left
And the happy things on the right
And there's a little corner saved just for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Please let me know if you change your mind
'Cause inside I'm falling
And I need you to pull me out of this decline
I realise how hard on you this must seem
But trust me when I say
It's far, far worse for me

[Chorus]
Please, please be here for me, dear
'Cause I've never needed a friend more
And I can't stress enough
How much it means to me that you're trying
And I don't mind if you can't hold me like you used to
'Cause I've never hated myself more
But this is just a bump in the road and I promise I'm trying

[Post-Chorus]
I promise I'm trying
(I promise I'm trying)
(I promise, I promise)

[Verse 2]
Give me a moment to get my cards in line
'Cause I'm still trying to figure out
In what kind of order should I set 'em out
If there was a way to explain everything without a word
I'd have a full house right now without a doubt

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying to tear the wool from your eyes
But a part of me wants to let you be
'Cause then you wouldn't see what I've become
I'm trying to shout but no sound comes out
It's like we're in a dream state
But I should've woken up
Woken up by now

[Chorus]
Please, please be here for me, dear
'Cause I've never needed a friend more
And I can't stress enough
How much it means to me that you're trying
And I don't mind if you can't hold me like you used to
'Cause I've never hated myself more
And this is just a bump in the road and I promise I'm trying

[Outro]
I promise I'm trying
