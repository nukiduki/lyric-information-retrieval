[Chorus]
You broke my heart
One too many times before-fore
I remember times on dance floor
I remember times when you'd go, now I'm happy alone
She stole my heart
I can't believe I fell for her tricks
I can't believe I passed on my life
I can't believe that times were like oh, oh, oh so good

[Verse 1]
No one to tell me how, no one to hurt me now
I thought we said our vows, I miss your disavow
Said, my feelings, you got the best of me
Motive was lust, you played me, basically
She told me that I'm quite a masochist, oh, I know
I can't believe it still hurts to kiss, so I won't
How could you ever say you wanted this, I sure don't
How could you ever say you'd rather be alone?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be honest, I'm so glad that I'm on my own
Glad I'm modest, finally gave time to myself
Now I'm breaking out of my shell
(Uh, bbno$)

[Chorus]
I can't believe you broke my heart
One too many times before-fore
I remember times on dance floor
I remember times when you'd go, now I'm happy alone
She stole my heart
I can't believe I fell for her tricks
I can't believe I passed on my life
I can't believe that times were like oh, oh, oh so good

[Verse 2]
I told myself I need nobody else
I was surprised on how the cards were dealt
I wasn't ever sure of how you felt
But I knew for certain I would take you back any time of day
Thank you to the adolescent me for my attitude
I never tell you ever what to be, I ain't mad at you
'Cause roses are red and violets are blue, I'm missing you
You stay in my head, not sure what to do, I'm leaving you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be honest, I'm so glad that I'm on my own
Glad I'm modest, finally gave time to myself
Now I'm breaking out of my shell

[Refrain]
I can't believe you broke my heart
One too many times before-fore
I remember times on dance floor
I remember times when you'd go, now I'm happy alone
She stole my heart
I can't believe I fell for her tricks
I can't believe I passed on my life
I can't believe that times were like oh, oh, oh so good

[Chorus]
You broke my heart
One too many times before-fore
I remember times on dance floor
I remember times when you'd go, now I'm happy alone
She stole my heart
I can't believe I fell for her tricks
I can't believe I passed on my life
I can't believe that times were like oh, oh, oh so good

[Outro]
(Oh, oh, oh so good)
