[Verse 1]
I wanna go, I wanna leave
I need some time away from me
And this is not an apology
Apologies aren't necessary
If this is it, let this be it
I need some time to talk it out
Don't be surprised, don't be alarmed
If first impressions start to let you down

[Chorus]
Maybe it's not your summer
Maybe it's not your year
Maybe it's not as easy for you to walk away and disappear
It feels like your ears are burning
Did someone really call your name?
Or maybe you were just daydreaming of somebody who can make your day
Maybe it's not your summer
Maybe it's not your summеr

[Verse 2]
I'm on the edge, I'm on thе brink
It took a while to walk away
Don't you forget, don't you be naive
Confusing love with a sunny day
It took a while to walk away

[Chorus]
Maybe it's not your summer
Maybe it's not your year
Maybe it's not as easy for you to walk away and disappear
It feels like your ears are burning
Did someone really call your name?
Or maybe you were just daydreaming of somebody who can make your day
Maybe it's not your summer
Maybe it's not your summer

[Bridge]
I wanna go, I wanna leave
I need some time away from me
And this is not an apology
Apologies aren't necessary

[Chorus]
Maybe it's not your summer
Maybe it's not your year
Maybe it's not as easy for you to walk away and disappear
It feels like your ears are burning
Did someone really call your name?
Or maybe you were just daydreaming of somebody who can make your day
Somebody who can make your day
Maybe it's not your summer
Maybe it's not your summer
