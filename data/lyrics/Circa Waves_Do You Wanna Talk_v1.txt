[Verse 1]
I hold on tight to something strong 'cause I'm about to fall
The Leaning Tower of Pisa's got nothing on me, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'd like to think that I call the shots
But my own reflection tells me I'm not

[Chorus]
And she said, "Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk?"
But I'm not thinking straight, I guess I'm gonna pay for this
"Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk?"
But both my eyes are glazed as I stumble away from you

[Verse 2]
I'm so removed I get consumed by every single song
I spilt my drink and now I think some coke heads kickin' off

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd like to think that I call the shots
But by the look on your face, I think I've not

[Chorus]
And she said, "Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk?"
But I'm not thinking straight, I guess I'm gonna pay for this
"Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk?"
But both my eyes are glazed as I stumble away from you, from you

[Bridge]
I don't know what I even said
I hope that it is something I won't regret
I don't know what I even said
I hope that it is something I won't regret

[Chorus]
And she said, "Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk?"
"Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk?"
"Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk?"
But both my eyes are glazed as I stumble away from you, from you
