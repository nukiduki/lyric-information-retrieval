If I told you drink my poison
Would you die for me
Would you let me hold you hostage
Make you cry for me
If I said
Would you lie for me
Kiss the barrel pull the trigger if its mine

Cross my heart, hope to die
Stick a needle in one eye
Do you feel me baby
Do I make you crazy
Yeah you say I'm your goddess
Well come drink this holy water
Do I drive you crazy
Do you want it baby

Pouring acid down your throat
Yeah, don't you know
It's the only way this can survive

If I told you drink my poison
Would you die for me
Would you let me hold you hostage
Make you cry for me
If I said nobody gotta know
Would you lie for me
Kiss the barrеl pull the trigger if its mine

Baby would you diе for me
Baby would you die (die for me)

Carve my name in your arm
So you wear me like a scar
So you'll feel me baby
Forever (ah ahhh)
Follow me to the afterlife (ahh)
Seeing heaven in my eyes
Dancing on the lake of fire
Kiss it, lick it
Sip it down

Pouring acid down your throat
Yeah don't you know
It's the only way this can survive

If I told you drink my poison
Would you die for me
Would you let me hold you hostage
Make you cry for me
If I said nobody gotta know
Would you lie for me
Kiss the barrel pull the trigger if its mine

Baby would you die for me
Baby would you die (die for me)

Would you ex out both your eyes
Cross over to the other side
Just to enter paradise with me
Do you swear it on your life
Catch a bullet
Fall on a knife
Would you be forever mine to keep
Do I make you wanna die

If I told you drink my poison
Would you die for me
Would you let me hold you hostage
Make you cry for me
If I said nobody gotta know
Would you lie for me
Kiss the barrel pull the trigger if its mine

Baby would you die for me
Baby would you die (die for me)

Dripping just like cherry wine
Ride into the velvet night
Would you get down on your knees for me
Baby would you
