[Intro]
(Pretty girl, pretty, pretty)
(Pretty girl, girl, pretty)

[Verse 1]
I've grown sick of my chest and wearin' baggy clothes
Always kissing dead ends like I don't know where the road leads
You need a different version of me to hold onto (To hold onto)

[Pre-Chorus]
What can I do?
I do want you
What would you do?

[Chorus]
Just wanna soften and let you in my world
You're so perfectly sweet but it's tasting bitter
'Cause I know to you I'll always be a pretty girl
Like I knew that this would happen

[Post-Chorus]
(Pretty girl, pretty, pretty)
(Pretty girl, girl, pretty)

[Verse 2]
And you don't need to talk, I already know
When I'm with you, can't help but feel alone
Say you need a different version of me to hold onto (To hold onto)

[Pre-Chorus]
What can I do?
I do want you
What would you do?

[Chorus]
Just wanna soften and let you in my world
You're so perfectly sweet but it's tasting bitter
'Cause I know to you I'll always be a pretty girl
Like I knew that this would happen
Just wanna talk when I let you in my world
She's so perfectly sweet, could you just forget her?
'Cause I know to you I'll always be a pretty girl
Like I knew that this would happen

[Outro]
Just wanna talk when I let you in my world
She's so perfectly sweet, could you just forget her?
'Cause I know to you I'll always be a pretty girl
Like I knew, I knew that this would happen
