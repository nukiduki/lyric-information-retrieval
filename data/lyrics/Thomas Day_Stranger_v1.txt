[Verse 1]
Are you okay? I just wanna help
Are you okay? Right now I can't tell
You don't seem like yourself

[Chorus]
And maybe I shouldn't have called
And maybe I never knew you at all
I'm thinking, maybe we should talk about it later
'Cause right now, you're acting like a stranger

[Verse 2]
So, go ahead and cut me off
Either way, you haven't lost yet
You still got a friend
I don't have a lot, so I keep 'em close
Even the ones that hurt me the most
Pickin' me up and putting me down
I'm just gonna wait 'til you figure it out

[Chorus]
Oh, but maybe I shouldn't have called
'Cause maybe I never knew you at all
I'm thinking, maybe we should talk about it later
'Cause right now, you're acting like a stranger

[Instrumental]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Outro]
Are you okay? I just wanna help
Are you okay? Right now I can't tell
You don't seem like yourself
