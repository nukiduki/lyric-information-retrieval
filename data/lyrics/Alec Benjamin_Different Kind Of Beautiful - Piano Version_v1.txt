[Intro]
You're a different kind of beautiful
The kind that makes me scared
The kind that makes me turn around and act like I'm not there
The kind that takes my breath away and leaves me without air
Maybe I'm delusional, you're just that kind of beautiful

[Verse 1]
I grab an hors d'oeuvre and head to the bar
I place an order, a tip in the jar
A couple of dollars I had in my car
I turn the corner and that's when I see
You in the corner there, starin' at me
Mind out of order and heart on my sleeve

[Pre-Chorus]
I was hopin' that I'd run into
You here, but now I'm stumblin'
And I can't seem to figure this out
Now I'm broken and I'm crumblin'
In the open and it's troublin'
But I see you and it fills me with doubt

[Chorus]
You're a different kind of beautiful
The kind that makes me scared
The kind that makes me turn around and act like I'm not there
The kind that takes my breath away and leaves me without air
Maybe I'm delusional, you're just that kind of beautiful
Different kind of beautiful, the kind that makes me fear
The kind that makes me turn around and act like I'm not here
The kind that takes my breath away every time you're near
Maybe I'm delusional, you're just that kind of beautiful (Beautiful)

[Verse 2]
I try to speak, but I can't find the words
Knees gettin' weak and my speech gettin' slurred
Hands feelin' heavy and vision is blurred (Oh-oh, no-no, no, no)
I don't even know what I wanted to say
Didn't expect to be feelin' this way
You turn your head and then you walk away (Oh-oh, no-no)

[Pre-Chorus]
I was hopin' that I'd run into
You here, but now I'm stumblin'
And I can't seem to figure this out
Now I'm broken and I'm crumblin'
In the open and it's troublin'
But I see you and it fills me with doubt

[Chorus]
You're a different kind of beautiful
The kind that makes me scared
The kind that makes me turn around and act like I'm not there
The kind that takes my breath away and leaves me without air
Maybe I'm delusional, you're just that kind of beautiful
Different kind of beautiful, the kind that makes me fear
The kind that makes me turn around and act like I'm not here
The kind that takes my breath away every time you're near
Maybe I'm delusional, you're just that kind of beautiful

[Post-Chorus]
And I'm helpless
And I'm helpless
Yeah, I'm helpless
Mm-mm, mm-hmm
