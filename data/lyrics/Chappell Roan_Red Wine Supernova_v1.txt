[Verse 1]
She was a playboy, Brigitte Bardot
She showed me things I didn't know
She did it right there out on the deck
Put her canine teeth in the side of my neck
I'm in the hallway waitin' for ya
Mini skirt and my go-go boots (Uh-Uh)
I just want you to make a move
So slow down, sit down, it's new

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna get to know ya
Guess I didn't quite think it through (Nah-uh, girl)
Fell in love with the thought of you
Now I'm choked up, face down, burnt out

[Chorus]
Baby, why don't you come over?
Red wine supernova, falling into me
(Let's pick it up now)
I don't care that you're a stoner
Red wine supernova, fall right into me

[Verse 2]
I like (I like)
What you like (What you like)
Long hair (No bra)
It's my type (That's right)
You just told me
Want me to fuck you
Baby, I will 'cause I really want to

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna get to know ya
Guess I didn't quite think it through (Nah-uh, girl)
Fell in love with the thought of you
Now I'm choked up, face down, burnt out

[Chorus]
Baby, why don't you come over?
Red wine supernova, falling into me
(Okay, y'all, let's pick it up now)
I don't care that you're a stoner
Red wine supernova, fall right into me

[Bridge]
Well, back at my house
I've got a California king
Okay, maybe it's a twin bed
And some roommates (Don't worry, we're cool)
I heard you like magic
I've got a wand and a rabbit
So baby, let's get freaky, get kinky
Let's make this bed get squeaky

[Chorus]
Baby, why don't you come over?
Red wine supernova, falling into me
I don't care that you're a stoner
Red wine supernova, fall right into me
