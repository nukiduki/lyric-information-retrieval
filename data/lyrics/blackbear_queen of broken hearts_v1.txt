[Chorus]
I'm the queen of broken hearts
Break you in a thousand parts
Used to be a shooting star
When did I become so dark?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you need to chill, girl, don't play me
I'm too far gone, you can't save me
And I don't care, fucking hate me
I popped a pill and I'm fading
Take anything, make it about me
It's a heavy crown, it might drown me
I know it sucks bein' around me
So does life, don't at me, don't doubt me

[Chorus]
I'm the queen of broken hearts
Break you in a thousand parts
Used to be a shooting star
When did I become so dark?
I'm the queen of broken hearts
Break you in a thousand parts
Used to be a shooting star
When did I become so dark?
I'm the queen of broken hearts
Left you with a thousand scars
Used to be a shooting star
When did I become so dark?

[Verse 2]
Block my posts and my story
I'm sorry, I can be annoying
I go ghost without warning
Popped a pill, now I'm snoring
Material girl, you can't afford me
This conversation got boring
You're so 2000 before me
You're in the past, you're yesterday morning

[Chorus]
I'm the queen of broken hearts
Break you in a thousand parts
Used to be a shooting star
When did I become so dark?
I'm the queen of broken hearts
Break you in a thousand parts
Used to be a shooting star
When did I become so dark?
I'm the queen of broken hearts
Left you with a thousand scars
Used to be a shooting star
When did I become so dark?

[Bridge]
Tell me, tell me I'm the worst
Make you cry and make you hurt
I'm the queen, bow down to me
I will leave you out to bleed
Tell me, tell me I'm the worst
Make you cry and make you hurt
I'm the queen, bow down to me
I will leave you out to bleed

[Chorus]
I'm the queen of broken hearts (Yeah)
Break you in a thousand parts (A thousand parts)
Used to be a shooting star
When did I become so dark?
I'm the queen of broken hearts (Broken hearts)
Left you with a thousand scars
Used to be a shooting star
When did I become so dark?

[Outro]
When did I
When did I become so dark?
When did I
When did I become so dark?
When did I
When did I become so dark?
Used to be a shooting star
When did I become so dark?
