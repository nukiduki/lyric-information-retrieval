[Intro: Craig Dixon]
Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom

[Verse 1: Alissic]
Bite your teeth and pretend that you're not all alone
And then, took a little time to figure
Took a little time, but now I know
You're so up in the clouds, no coming back down

[Pre-Chorus: Alissic]
Congratulations, you made your heart vacant
Now I'm down, down, down, down, low like a basement
Manipulations, my double agent
Thinking how to say fuck you in a really nice way

[Chorus: Alissic]
Do you think I'm stupid?
What do you take me for?
You left me cryin' on the bedroom floor
You played me like a piano, piano
You played me like a piano

[Verse 2: Alissic]
Underneath your discontent, tried to act like you never cared
And I don't want to live forever
But you don't even care if your heartbeat stops
You're so up in the clouds, why don't you sort yourself out?

[Pre-Chorus: Alissic]
Congratulations, you made your heart vacant
Now I'm down, down, down, down, low like a basement
Manipulations, my double agent
Thinking how to say fuck you in a really nice way

[Chorus: Alissic]
Do you think I'm stupid?
What do you take me for? (Take me for)
You left me cryin' on the bedroom floor
You played me like a piano, piano
You played me like a, you played me like a piano

[Bridge: Alissic]
I'm crying like a cloud
I'm crying like a cloud
(I hope she doesn't hurt
I hope she doesn't hurt)

[Chorus: Alissic]
Do you think I'm stupid?
What do you take me for?
You left me cryin' on the bedroom floor
You played me like a piano, piano
You played me like a, you played me like a
You played me like a piano
