[Chorus]
We're lonely dancers
Join me for the night
We're lonely dancers, baby
Dance with me so we don't cry
We're lonely dancers
There's no need to hide
I know the answer, baby
Dance with me so we don't cry

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la-la-la, cry
La-la-la-la-la

[Verse]
Your lover left you, broke up tonight
My lover's busy kissin' other guys, oh
We're both alone now, tears in our eyes
I know the perfect way to waste our time

[Chorus]
We'rе lonely dancers
Join me for thе night
We're lonely dancers, baby
Dance with me so we don't cry
We're lonely dancers
There's no need to hide
I know the answer, baby
Dance with me so we don't cry

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, la-la-la-la-la, cry
Oh-oh-oh-oh, la-la-la-la-la

[Bridge]
Wait, stop, forget that guy
He don't know love, I hope he dies
Get (Get) back (Back) up (Up), we'll be alright
Tonight, you're mine (Tonight, you're mine, tonight, you're mine)

[Chorus]
We're lonely dancers
Join me for the night (Hey)
We're lonely dancers, baby
Dance with me so we don't cry
We're lonely dancers
There's no need to hide (Hide, oh)
I know the answer, baby
Dance with me so we don't cry

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, la-la-la-la-la, cry
Oh-oh-oh-oh, dance with me so we don't cry
Oh-oh-oh-oh, la-la-la-la-la, cry
Oh-oh-oh-oh, dance with me so we don't cry
