[Verse 1]
Oh, I leave quite an impression
Five feet to be exact
You're wonderin' why half his clothes went missin'
My body's where they're at

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
Next to me, one degree of separation

[Chorus]
I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do
Just know you'll taste me too

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh

[Verse 2]
He pins you down on the carpet
Makes paintings with his tongue (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Hе's funny now, all his jokes hit different
Guеss who he learned that from?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
Next to me, one degree of separation

[Chorus]
I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do (I bet you do)
Just know you'll taste me too

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Bridge]
Every time you close your eyes
And feel his lips, you're feelin' mine
And every time you breathe his air
Just know I was already there
You can have him if you like
I've been there, done that once or twice
And singin' 'bout it don't mean I care
Yeah, I know I've been known to share

[Chorus]
Well, I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do (I bet you do)
Just know you'll taste me too

[Outro]
Taste me too, ow (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
You, no, yeah, ah-ah (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
