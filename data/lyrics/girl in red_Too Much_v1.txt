[Verse 1]
Don't you just love
To kill the light in my eyes
To make me low when I’m high
Oh-woah, oh (It's just a, it's just a)
"It’s just a joke"
You always say afterwards
Still my feelings get hurt
Oh-woah, oh

[Chorus]
So please
Don't say I'm too much
That I'm over the top
You don't understand me
We're so different at heart
You're on Earth, I'm on Mars, ah-ah

[Verse 2]
All I ever wanted was your love
I toned myself down for you
Volume one, almost mute
I’ll never ignite
You always found a way to bring me down
You trivialised everything
From my tears to my grins
Oh-woah, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s like you're scared of anything real (What?)
For a second I thought you were sincere (What?)
But you’ve been dragging me down all of these years (What?)
With your coldness, and I don't care

[Chorus]
So please
Don't say I'm too much
That I’m over the top
You don't understand me
Yeah, we're so different at heart
You're on Earth, I'm on Mars, oh-oh

[Bridge]
You go through life like you're on, on a—
You go through life like you're on a fucking runway
Dracula shoulders, they be blockin' all my sunrays
This throwin' shade is so passé
Forever is unlikely for us
Opposites attract, odds are more like Blackjack
House always wins, so I'm taking all my love back
With you, I lose either way

[Pre-Chorus]
You think I'm weird when I get too excited (What?)
I think it's weird how you're so empty-minded (What?)
Yeah, you've been dragging me down all of these years (What?)
With your coolness, and I don't care

[Chorus]
So please
Don't say I'm too much
That I'm over the top
You don't understand me
Yeah, we're so different at heart
You're on Earth, I'm on Mars
But I still keep tryin'
