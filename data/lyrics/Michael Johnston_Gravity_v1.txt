[Verse 1]
I had it for you
One afternoon
Never thought I'd be chasing somebody like you
You make me crazy
I'm on the moon, yeah
My gravity is broke when I am missing you
I fly through the universe
I'm in reverse
I want to take you with me 'cause I think I can
Show you a better way
To run away

[Chorus]
Don't tell me you were lonely
Let me take you to the apogee
We can be anyone we want to be
We could go on and on ('Til we run out of gravity)
(We could go on and on) Until we run out of gravity
And wе could be human and we could be free
And wе could be floating in the galaxy
And we could go on and on('Til we run out of gravity)
Until we run out of gravity

[Verse 2]
I think about you
When you're away
I try to guess if you were here, what you would say?
My heart is racing
I'm letting go, I
Never thought I'd be leaving everything I know
I fly through the universe
There's nothing worse
Than wishing things were different, I just want you to
Show me another way
We'll be ok

[Chorus]
Don't tell me you were lonely
Let me take you to the apogee
We can be anyone we want to be
We could go on and on ('Til we run out of gravity)
(We could go on and on) Until we run out of gravity
And we could be human and we could be free
And we could be floating in the galaxy
And we could go on and on ('Til we run out of gravity)
Until we run out of gravity

[Bridge]
I never thought it'd be true, I
Think I'm falling for you
You took my hand and we flew
Oh, we'll never beat this view
I never thought it'd be true, I
Think I'm falling for you
You took my hand and we flew
Oh, we'll never beat this view
Until we run out of gravity
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
('Til we run out of gravity)

[Chorus]
And we could be human and we could be free
And we could be floating in the galaxy
And we could go on and on ('Til we run out of gravity)
Until we run out of gravity

[Outro]
Let me take you to the apogee
We can be anyone we want to be
We can go on and on
We can go on and on and on
