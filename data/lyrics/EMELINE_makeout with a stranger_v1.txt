[Verse 1]
Pretty boy, we've been here a while
Undefined love, good sex, no title
Idiot shit, it makes me spiral (Spiral, spiral, spiral)
Adrenaline rush when we collided
Sit on your face to keep you silent
Hot as fuck but I just decided
I'm too tired, you're uninvited

[Pre Chorus]
I guess this means it's over, babe
It's tragic 'cause I had to save me
I, I'm sorry 'cause I'm not

[Chorus]
I wanna make out with a stranger, to get you out of my head
I'll be a player, baby, I learned from the bеst
Take her, kiss him, nevеr miss them
'Til you're just a stranger to me
I wanna make out with a stranger, somebody I can forget
Under the blanket, doing what you do with your ex
Touching, screaming, biting, leaving
Until you're just a stranger to me

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-ooh, ooh
Oh-oh-ooh, ooh (I wanna make out with a stranger)
Oh-oh-ooh, ooh
'Til all you'll ever be is just a stranger to me

[Verse 2]
I'm a heart broke turned to a heartbreaker
The best decision that I ever made was "See you later"
'Cause now I'm on my own everybody wanna taste it
And you'll be someone I forgot

[Pre Chorus]
I guess this means it's over, babe
It's tragic 'cause I had to save me
I, I'm sorry 'cause I'm not

[Chorus]
I wanna make out with a stranger, to get you out of my head
I'll be a player, baby, I learned from the best
Take her, kiss him, never miss them
'Til you're just a stranger to me
I wanna make out with a stranger, somebody I can forget
Under the blanket, doing what you do with your ex
Touching, screaming, biting, leaving
Until you're just a stranger to me

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-ooh, ooh
(Until you're just a stranger, stranger)
Oh-oh-ooh, ooh (I wanna make out with a stranger)
Oh-oh-ooh, ooh (Oh)
'Til all you'll ever be is just a stranger to me

[Outro]
Fuck you, I'm so fucking over it
I'm gonna go kiss some hard-ass bitch at the club
But it's not gonna be you
'Cause you fucking suck
