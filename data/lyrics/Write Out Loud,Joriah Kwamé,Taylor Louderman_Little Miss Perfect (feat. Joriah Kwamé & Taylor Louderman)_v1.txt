[Verse 1]
Straight hair, straight A's, straightforward
Straight path, I don't cut corners
I make a point to be on time
Head of the student council
I don't black out at parties
I jam to Paul McCartney
If you ask me how I'm doin', I'll say, "Well, hm"
I was adopted when I was two
My parents spoiled me rotten
Often I ask myself, "What did I do
To get as far as I've gotten?"
A pretty girl walks by my locker
My heart gives a flutter, but I don't dare utter a word
'Cause that would be absurd behavior for Little Miss Perfect

[Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, no
I can't risk falling off my throne
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, love
Is something I don't even know

[Post-Chorus]
Straight hair, straight A's
Straightforward, straight girl
Little Miss Perfect, that's me

[Verse 2]
One night, my friend stayed over
We laughed and drank and ordered
Something about her drew me in
Wait, it's totally platonic
That night was so exciting
Her smirks were so enticing
Hours speed by like seconds, then
What happens is iconic
She takes a sip, I bite my lip
She tells a joke, I nearly choke
She braids my hair
I sit there blacking out for the first time
Next thing I know, I lose control
I finally kiss her, but, oh no
I see a face in my window
Then my brain starts to go

[Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, no
You can't risk falling off your throne
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, love
Is something you don't even know
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
You can't risk falling off your throne
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, love
You don't even know

[Outro]
Rewind, induce amnesia
Deny the truth, it's easier
You're just confused, believe her
When she says there's nothing there
It's never worth it
When you're Little Miss Perfect
