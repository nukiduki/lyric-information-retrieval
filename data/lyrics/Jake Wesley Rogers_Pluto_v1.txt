[Verse 1]
When I was a kid
Pluto was still a planet
I'm still kinda sad about it, oh
Thought I was the shit
'Til someone made me doubt it
I'm still kinda mad about it

[Pre-Chorus]
I could buy me a rainbow
I'm a little afraid though
It won't look good with my halo

[Chorus]
Hate on me, hate on me, hate on me, hate on me
You might as well hate the sun
For shining just a little too much
Hate on me, hate on me, hate on me, hate on me
Maybe at the end of the day
You and me are both the same
We just wanna be loved, loved
We just wanna be loved

[Verse 2]
I think of my mom
She loves me no matter what
And that really fucks me up
I can't be the best
There's so many killers out there
Dying in hotels somewhere

[Pre-Chorus]
I could buy me a rainbow
I'm a little afraid though
It might start to fade, oh

[Chorus]
Hate on me, hate on me, hate on me, hate on me
You might as well hate the sun
For shining just a little too much
Hate on me, hate on me, hate on me, hate on me
You might as well do it today
You and me are both the same
We just wanna be loved, loved
We just wanna be loved, loved
Hate on me, hate on me, hate on me, hate on me
You might as well curse the sun
For shining just a little too much
Hate on me, hate on me, hate on me, hate on me
Maybe at the end of the day
You and me are both the same
We just wanna be loved

[Outro]
Just wanna be loved, baby
Just gotta love
(Love)
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, baby
Yeah
I know you can, know you can
If you love me, let it fly
Let it fly, let it fly, let it fly, let it fly, oh
(Love) Know you gotta try
