[Verse 1]
Seekest thou the road to all that's foul and fair
Gather sisters fire, water, earth and air
Darkest hour, wake thy power, earthly and divine
Burn and brew with coven true and glory shall be thine

[Chorus]
Down, down, down the road
Down the witches' road
Down, down, down the road
Down the witches' road
Down, down, down the road
Down the witches' road
Circle sewn with fate
Unlock thy hidden gate

[Verse 2]
Marching ever forward 'neath the wooded shrine
I stray not from the path, I hold death's hand in mine
Primal night, giveth sight familiar by thy side
If onе be gone, we carry on, spirit as our guidе

[Chorus]
Down, down, down the road
Down the witches' road (Down the witches' road)
Down, down, down the road (Down the witches' road)
Down the witches' road (Down the witches' road)
Down, down, down the road (Down the witches' road)
Down the witches' road (Down the witches' road)
Blood and tears and bone
Maiden, Mother, Crone

[Verse 3]
The road is wild and wicked, winding through the wood
Where all that's wrong is right and all that's bad is good
Through many miles of tricks and trials, we'll wander high and low
Tame your fears, a door appears, the time has come to go

[Chorus]
Down, down, down the road (Down, down, down, down)
Down the witches' road (Down the witches' road)
Down, down, down the road (Down the witches' road)
Down the witches' road (Down the witches' road)
Down, down, down the road (Down the witches' road)
Down the witches' road (Down the witches' road)
Follow me, my friend
To glory at the end
