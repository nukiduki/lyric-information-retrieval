[Verse 1]
Can you hear all of my open wounds?
I'm whispering as loud as the flowers bloom
I've been somewhere in the sky, don't worry
I'll be right on time if I can help it
I'm so sorry

[Chorus]
I've been trying not to cry in the grocery store
(Trying not to cry in the grocery store)
Little bully inside pinning me to the floor
(Bully inside pinning me to the floor)
It must be easier than it seems
But I can't get these thorns out of my teeth
It's killing me but I want more
(It's killing me but, it's killing me but)

[Verse 2]
Cover my ears, I think I'm shutting down
Going standby, sleep mode, offline
Feel nothing, it's quiet as hеll in my room
I've been fighting for my sanctuary
How do I stay alive if I don't wanna be?

[Chorus]
I'vе been trying not to cry in the grocery store
Little bully inside pinning me to the floor
It must be easier than it seems
But I can't get these thorns out of my teeth
It's killing me but I want more
