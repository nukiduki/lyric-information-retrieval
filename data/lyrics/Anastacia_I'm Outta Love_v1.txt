[Verse 1]
Now, baby, come on
Don't claim that love you never let me feel
I should have known
'Cause you brought nothing real
Come on, be a man about it, you won't die
I ain't got no more tears to cry
And I can't take this no more
You know I gotta let it go
And you know

[Chorus]
I'm outta love, set me free
And let me out this misery
Just show me the way to get my life again
'Cause you can't handle me
Said I'm outta love, can't you see
Baby, that you gotta set me free?
I'm outta love

[Verse 2]
Said how many times
Have I tried to turn this love around?
But every time you just let me down
Come on, be a man about it, you'll survive
True that you can work it out all right
Tell me, yesterday did you know
I'd be the one to let you go?
And you know

[Chorus]
I'm outta love, set me free (set me free)
And let me out this misery (Oh, let me out this misery)
Show me the way to live my life again
You can't handle me
I'm outta love, can't you see
Baby, that you gotta set me free
I'm outta

[Bridge]
Let me get over you
The way you've gotten over me too, yeah
Seems like my time has come
And now I'm moving on
I'll be stronger

[Chorus]
I'm outta love, set me free (set me free)
And let me out this misery
Show me the way to live my life again
You can't handle me (no, no)
Said I'm outta love, set me free
And let me out this misery
Show me the way to get my life again
You can't handle me
Said I'm outta love, can't you see (can't you see?)
Baby, that you gotta set me free?
I'm outta love
I'm outta love, set me free (no, no, no)
And let me out this misery (out this misery)
Just show me the way to get my life again
'Cause you can't handle me (no, no)
Said I'm outta love, set me free
And let me out this misery
