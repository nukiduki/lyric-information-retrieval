[Verse 1: WILLOW]
When I wake up, I can't even stay up
I slept through the day, fuck
I'm not getting younger
But when I'm older, I'll be so much stronger
I'll stay up for longer
Meet me at our spot

[Chorus: WILLOW]
Caught a vibe (Woo, woo)
Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
I just wanna look into your eyes (Your eyes, your eyes)
I just wanna stay for the night, night, night
When we take a drive (Woo, woo)
Maybe we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life

[Verse 2: Tyler Cole & WILLOW]
When I go to sleep, I can't even fall asleep
Something's got ahold of me
Feel it taking over me
But when I'm older I'll be moving onward
I just got a drunk text
(Meet me at our spot)

[Chorus: Tyler Cole]
We caught a vibe (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
When I look into your eyes (Your eyes, your eyes)
I just wanna hold you all night (All night)
Maybe we can take a drive (Take a drive)
Baby, we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life

[Bridge: WILLOW]
Meet me at our spot
Got something I wanna show you
Meet me at our spot
They can't find us there
Meet me at our spot
Got something I wanna show you
Meet me at our spot
They can't find us there

[Chorus: WILLOW & Tyler Cole]
Caught a vibe (Woo, woo)
Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
I just wanna look into your eyes (Into your eyes)
I just wanna stay for the night, night, night
When we take a drive (Woo, woo)
Maybe we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life
