[Verse 1]
Growing up on the internet
Think it'll fuck your head
All of the shit you get served
It still hasn't hit me yet
All of the creeps I met
All of the friend request pervs
I'm an ADHD, LGBT, L-M-N-O-P, I
I'm not the one who should be barred from the community
I'm throwing up on the internet
Seething in deep regret
Thinking it's what I deserve

[Pre-Chorus]
All night, gaslight, on and on

[Chorus]
I wanna wreck it
I wanna turn you off
It's getting hectic
I'm turning back the clocks (Rewind it all)
To reverse all of the damage that's been done
I'll make my еxit
I'm not the only one

[Post-Chorus]
(Growing up on the intеrnet)
(Up on the internet)
(Up on the internet)
(Growing up on the internet)
(Up on the internet)
(Up on the internet)

[Verse 2]
Growing up on the internet
Think it'll fuck your head
All of the shit you digest
It still hasn't hit me yet
All of the pics I sent
Just for a weight off my chest
I'm a parasocial, anti-totalist anomaly
I just started laughing when a nonce got a tattoo of me
I'm blowing up on the internet
Putting the noise to bed
Thinking it's time for a rest

[Pre-Chorus]
All night, gaslight, on and on
Pixelate to find where I belong
Suffocate the point where I went wrong

[Chorus]
I wanna wreck it
I wanna turn you off
It's getting hectic
I'm turning back the clocks (Rewind it all)
To reverse all of the damage that's been done
I'll make my exit
I'm not the only one

[Bridge]
Rewind it all
(Growing up on the internet)
(Up on the internet)
(Up on the internet)
(Growing up on the internet)
(Up on the internet)
(Up on the internet)
Rewind it all
(Growing up on the internet)
(Up on the internet)
(Up on the internet)
(Growing up on the internet)
(Up on the internet)
(Up on the internet)

[Chorus]
I wanna wreck it
I wanna turn you off
It's getting hectic
I'm turning back the clocks (Rewind it all)
To reverse all of the damage that's been done
I'll make my exit
I'm not the only one
I wanna wreck it
I wanna turn you off
It's getting hectic
I'm turning back the clocks (Rewind it all)
To reverse all of the damage that's been done
I'll make my exit
I'm not the only one
