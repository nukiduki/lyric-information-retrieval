[Verse 1]
First, I'll say, "I apologize for calling
But I saw your face in a magazine today"
Wasn’t you, too late, all my tears already fallin'
Tried to turn the page, but our story wasn't stoppin’

[Chorus]
And it goes on, and on, and on
Like a never ending song
On and on
Like a never ending song

[Verse 2]
You and I sacrificed my adolescence
Just to waste my time on the edges of your life
But we've grown too close, now it can't amount to nothin'
I can hear your voice in the music on the radio

[Chorus]
And it goes on, and on, and on
Like a never ending song
On and on
Like a nevеr ending song (Uh)

[Bridge]
Can you make us stay forevеr?
Are we done? Can you make it play?

[Chorus]
On, and on, and on (On)
Like a never ending song
On and on (On)
Like a never ending song
On and on (On)

[Outro]
On and on (Ooh)
Like a never ending song
