[Verse 1]
Cold bones, yeah that’s my love
She hides away, like a ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
Does she know that we bleed the same?
Don’t wanna cry but I break that way

[Verse 2]
Cold sheets, oh where’s my love?
I am searching high, I’m searching low in the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Does she know that we bleed the same?
Don’t wanna cry but I break that way

[Chorus]
Did she run away?
Did she run away? I don’t know
If she ran away
If she ran away, come back home
Just come home

[Bridge]
I got a fear, oh in my blood
She was carried up into the clouds, high above

[Pre-chorus]
If you bled, I bleed the same
If you’re scared, I’m on my way

[Chorus]
Did you run away?
Did you run away? I don’t need to know
If you ran away
If you ran away, come back home
Just come home
