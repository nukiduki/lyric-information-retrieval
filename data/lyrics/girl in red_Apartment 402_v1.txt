[Verse 1]
There's a pain
There's no doubt
I've been through hell
But on my way out

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the ways I've been torn
Stripped my heart to the core
All of my fears combined
Walking the thinnest of lines

[Chorus]
When the sunlight hits the dust
And I can't get up
When the noise is way too much
I close the void and burn it off
But there's a crack in every wall
Is there a way out after all?
If I lose my grip and fall
Will I?

[Verse 2]
There's a place
With no hate
Touched by grace
Quiet as faith

[Pre-Chorus]
Emptied my hеart, laid down my cards
Played my best part, wanting a new start
All of my fеars combined
Taught me to run and hide

[Chorus]
When the sunlight hits the dust
And I can't get up
When the noise is way too much
I close the void and burn it off
But there's a crack in every wall
Is there a way out after all?
If I lose my grip and fall
Will I?

[Bridge]
There's a dissonance in all that I do
Yeah, nothing feels right or true
Black out on the floor just once more
The place I call my home
Yeah, I could die here and nobody would know
Die here and nobody would know

[Chorus]
When the sunlight hits the dust
And I can't get up
When the noise is just too much
I close the void and burn it off
But there's a crack in every wall
Is there a way out after all?
If I lose my grip and fall
Will I die?
