[Intro]
(Run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy)

[Verse 1]
I am nothin' but the average
Even though I'm special to some
I can't refuse, I'm going under
No one gives a shit about what's soon to come
What's soon to come
I know my blessing with the privilege
Of doin' anything I want
But I don't feel like getting stronger
In my mind, it's just a game that can't be won
That can't be won

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm always on the run, run, run, run
Close, but never done, done, done, done
I can't break out when I'm free
Lost in my own identity
I'm on the run, run, run, run

[Chorus]
I'm always on the run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy
Run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy
(It's like I'm on the) Run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy
Run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy

[Verse 2]
All I do is keep my head up
But it's time to keep the pace
Like I'm haunted by the voices deep within
Oh, they just never gonna fade (Run, na-na-ayy)
Not gonna fade (Run, na-na-ayy)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm always on the run, run, run, run
Close, but never done, done, done, done
I can't break out when I'm free
Lost in my own identity
I'm on the run, run, run, run

[Chorus]
I'm always on the run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy
Run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy
(It's like I'm on the) Run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy
Run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy

[Bridge]
Run from the silence, screamin' for guidance
Who am I fighting for?
Get out of my head, I'm so sick and tired
Can't do this anymore
Run from the silence, screamin' for guidance
Who am I fighting for?
Get out of my head, I'm so sick and tired
Can't do this anymore

[Outro]
Run from the silence, screamin' for guidance (Run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy)
Who am I fighting for? (Run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy)
Get out of my head, I'm so sick and tired (Run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy)
Can't do this anymore (Run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy)
Run from the silence, screamin' for guidance (Run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy)
Who am I fighting for? (Run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy)
Get out of my head, I'm so sick and tired (Run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy)
Can't do this anymore (Run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy)
