[Verse 1]
I'm stupid
I'll build a rocket for ya
I'm losing all my self-respect
I'm wasted
I've had no alcohol and
I tell you now I haven't slept

[Refrain]
That hasn't happened to you yet
That hasn't happened to you yet

[Verse 2]
I passed time debating why you'd even wanna be with me in the first place
I'd hate to sigh, the paint won't dry
So buddy, let's pick up the pace
Calm me down for the thousandth time
But I still won't hear what you say
Love's not blind, and that's a crime
So just say it to my face
Put me in my place

[Refrain]
That hasn't happened to you yet
That hasn't happened to you yet

[Chorus]
It takes its toll and breaks my soul
And my mind just won't leave me
Alone, I'd agree that it's all just me
So just don't pick up that phone

[Refrain]
That hasn't happened to you yet (Heh heh)
That hasn't happened to you yet

[Bridge]
I'm useless
I haven't showered in a bit
I wasn't cut out for this shit
I'm clueless
I doubt myself just for the hit
I wasn't cut out for this shit
I might need to quit

[Chorus]
It takes its toll and breaks my soul
And my mind just won't leave me
Alone, I'd agree that it's all just me
So just don't pick up that phone
It takes its toll and breaks my soul
And my mind just won't leave me
Alone, I'd agree that it's all just me
So just don't pick up that phone

[Outro]
God, I'm going home
Fuck, I'm going home
That hasn't happened to you yet
