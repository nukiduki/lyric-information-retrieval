[Intro]
My day will come, I gave too much
I sold my soul, I'm waiting for my pay in full
I only want your dying love, I seen enough

[Chorus]
I tried, but I don't think so
Maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give, but
It seems like it never really was enough

[Verse 1]
I feel left out, I don't see how
My whole life can change in one week
I don't mind my own reflection
I don't see how you've been let down
Don't speak 'less you have to
Why you always seem in a bad mood?
Your whole life, you had an attitude
One day, is that so bad for you?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if it got that bad
I'm sorry I can't help you
Somebody should've had your back

[Chorus]
I tried, but I don't think so
Maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give, but
It seems like it never really was enough

[Verse 2]
I changed my whole life when
I learned to ignore them
I changed my whole life up
Maybe it was not enough
I don't think I'm allowed to
Make a deal with your selfish ways
They're acting vicious out there
There's lots of demons out here

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if it got that bad
I'm sorry I can't help you
Somebody should've had your back

[Chorus]
I tried, but I don't think so
Maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give, but
It seems like it never really was enough
