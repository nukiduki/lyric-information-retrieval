Nights of broken sleep with the wrong people in my dreams
Last night I woke up to the sound of myself
Trying to figure out what all this means
I didn’t find a damn thing
I’m begging and pleading for some consistency
Just an inkling of stability

My half-lit headlights are making it hard to see a thing
On this drive home

We’re all lost souls trying to find a way to happiness
It might be tough to drag yourself up and away
From the mess you’ve made
It’s easy to complain about the hand that you’ve been dealt
But you know that you’re the only one to blame
The world never owed you anything

I always thought I had it figured out
That sincerity was the way I’d end up
With the life I wanted
But twenty-three years on my hands have never felt so empty
The promises I let myself believe keep
Slipping from my grasp

We’re all lost souls trying to find a way to happiness
It might be tough to drag yourself up
And away from the mess you’ve made
It’s easy to complain about the hand that you’ve been dealt
But you know that you’re the only one to blame
The world never owed you anything

I’m sleep deprived
Looking for anything to calm my racing mind
Most of these nights
It feels like I won’t make it to the morning

We’re all lost souls trying to find a way to happiness
It might be tough to drag yourself up
And away from the mess you’ve made
It’s easy to complain about the hand that you’ve been dealt
But you know that you’re the only one to blame
The world never owed you anything
