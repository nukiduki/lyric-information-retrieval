[Intro]
Yeah, I'm up here to give it to ya (Diverse City)
Gonna take ya higher
(Freakshow, baby)
[?]
Flow with me, the funk on me (Diverse City)
Gonna take ya higher
(Freakshow, baby)

[Chorus]
They call us Diverse City, we're colorful good
It's like a freak show (Freakshow) in your neighborhood (Ah)
So, if you wanna praise you can come on down
'Cause this freak show's leavin' the ground  (Diverse City)

[Verse 1]
Up, up, and away, baby, we don't play
Maybe you thought you was done for the day
He said, she said, I said this
That you can't get away from the moment of bliss
Stirring, we'll lure you in (We'll lure you in)
And we'll make room for the shade of skin
Short ones, tall ones, skinny ones, bigger
Love is the gun, and we pullin' that trigger (Trigger)
So you send me and I'll send you
Hope in the form of a new tattoo
Mine is the shiny city on a hill
And yours, of course, is the colors that fill it (Fill it, fill it, fill it, fill it, fill it, fill it, fill it)

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll take ya higher, we'll take ya higher, we'll take ya higher

[Chorus]
They call us Diverse City (Wow), we're colorful good
It's like a freak show (Freakshow) in your neighborhood
So, if you wanna praise you can come on down
'Cause this freak show's leavin' the ground (Diverse City)

[Verse 2: Mr. Talkbox]
Now come to the city where you can praise
If you're black, if you're white, if you're yellow or grey
In the morning, in the night, any time of day
What's that place?' (Diverse City!)
With curls in your hair and braids on the side
Straight shake 'em loose, just come on and ride (Come on and ride)
We're a body with parts, like you and me
Together we make diversity

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll take ya higher, we'll take ya higher, we'll take ya higher

[Chorus]
Welcome to Diverse City (Wow), we're colorful good (Woo)
It's like a freak show (Freakshow) in your neighborhood (Yeah, woo)
So, if you wanna praise you can come on down (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause this freak show's leavin' the ground

Said we're Diverse City, we're colorful good (Diverse City)
It's just a state of mind (We gon' shine), the way that we should, baby
So, if you wanna praise you can come on down (Diverse City)
'Cause this freak show's leavin' the ground (Up, up, and away)

[Bridge]
Di-verse
City, alright (Come on down)
Di-verse
Got it, baby, one body
Di-verse
City, alright (Come on down)
Di-verse
Got it, baby, one body

[Verse 3]
You bring the heart, I'll bring the soul (Soul)
I'll bring the flag, you bring the pole (Pole)
We'll fly it high so the whole world knows (Knows)
The dream of a King 'bout to unfold
We 'bout to do this thing for real
Diverse City got mass appeal
So put your hand in the hand of mine
And we'll spread this love like dandelions

[Chorus]
'Cause we're Diverse City, we're colorful good (Ooh)
It's like a freak show, oh it's like a freak show, baby
So, if you wanna praise you can come on down
'Cause this freak show's leavin' the ground (Leavin' the ground)

Said weâ€™re Diverse City, we're colorful good (Diverse City)
Diverse City's rollin' right up into your neighborhood
(Ladies) If you wanna praise
You can come on down (Diverse City)
'Cause this freak show's leavin' the ground
(We'll take ya, we'll take ya)

[Outro]
Diverse City
Oh, it's like a freak show
Like a city on a hill
Diverse City
Oh, it's like a freak show
Like a city on a, city on a hill

Diverse City
And we will never be that shinin' city on a hill
Until we truly become
Diverse City
A diverse city

Spreadin' the Good News, baby
Gospe-zillio
And that's for real-ito
