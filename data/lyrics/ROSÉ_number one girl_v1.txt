[Verse 1]
Tell me that I'm special, tell me I look pretty
Tell me I'm a little angel, sweetheart of your city
Say what I'm dying to hear
'Cause I'm dying to hear you

[Verse 2]
Tell me I'm that new thing, tell me that I'm relevant
Tell me that I got a big heart, then back it up with evidence
I need it and I don't know why
This late at night

[Chorus]
Isn't it lonely?
I'd do anything to make you want me
I'd give it all up if you told me that I'd be
The number one girl in your eyes
Your one and only
So what's it gon' take for you to want me?
I'd give it all up if you told me that I'd be
The number one girl in your eyes

[Verse 3]
Tell me I'm going real big places, down to earth, so friendly
And even through all the phases, tell me you accept me
Well, that's all I'm dying to hear
Yeah, I'm dying to hear you

[Verse 4]
Tell me that you need me, tell me that I'm loved
Tell me that I'm worth it, and that I'm enough
I need it and I don't know why
This late at night

[Chorus]
Isn't it lonely?
I'd do anything to make you want me
I'd give it all up if you told me that I'd be
The number one girl in your eyes
Your one and only
So what's it gon' take for you to want me?
I'd give it all up if you told me that I'd be
The number one girl in your eyes

[Bridge]
The girl in your eyes, the girl in your eyes
Tell me I'm the number one girl
I'm the number one girl in your eyes
The girl in your eyes, the girl in your eyes
Tell me I'm the number one girl
I'm the number one girl in your eyes

[Chorus]
Well, isn't it lonely?
I'd do anything to make you want me
I'd give it all up if you told me that I'd be
The number one girl in your eyes
Your one and only
So what's it gon' take for you to want me?
I'd give it all up if you told me that I'd be
The number one girl in your eyes
The number one girl in your eyes
