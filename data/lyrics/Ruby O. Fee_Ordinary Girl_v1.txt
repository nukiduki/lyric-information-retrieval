[SOPHIA]
I'm just an ordinary girl with an ordinary wish
I want love
I'm just an ordinary girl in this confusing world
Give me love

You see me walking in these grown up shoes
But I don't know where to go
Eyes fall on me, but what you really see
Is a lonely soul, all alone

I'm just an ordinary girl with no ordinary life
I miss love
I'm just an ordinary girl in this confusing world
Where's my love?

Behind this smile, there's a waterfall
Leading to an ocean full of fears
What you see is not what you get
In my queen-size bed I'm all alone

I'm just an ordinary girl in no ordinary world
Don't know where to go
Don't know where's my home
All alone

I'm just an ordinary girl with an ordinary wish
I want love
I'm just an ordinary girl in this confusing world
Give me love
