[Intro]
I feel pink, yeah
Lalalalala, lalalala
I feel pink
Lalalala
(hahaha!)

Just like a
Just like a
Just like a
Just like a
Just like a
Just like a
Just like a freak!

[Verse 1]
I've been in bed since 7 AM but I haven't slept yet (just like a...)
There's fog in my head so I can't keep track, but I think the sun set (just like a...)
Uh oh, forgot how to breathe for a sec (just like a...)
And you think I'm fine because how I dress doesn't reflect that
You say I'm blue when I cry
But you can't see sad with your eyes
(Freak!)
I know they think I'm a freak (freak)
Cuz everything I wear is pink (freak)
My laces (freak)
My glasses (freak freak freak freak)
Even my heart on my sleeve is pink

[Pre-Chorus]
I've tried to be what people think of when they see me (just like a...)
That gave me an ego that wasn't even mine, though
Yeah, I know I look fine
But you can't see sad with your eyes

[Chorus]
I feel pink, yeah
Lalalalala, lalalala
You say that I'm blue
But I feel pink, yeah
Lalalalala, lalalala
I'm just not like you
Cuz when I sink
I feel so pink, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Just like a freak!
Just like a frea- uh oh!
Just like a freak!

[Verse 2]
I've worn the same t-shirt
I haven't washed my hair
But all of that's fine when I don't go outside
‘Cause lately I'm not fond of the light
So I colored in all of the lenses on my glasses
And stay in bed because it's better when I'm fast asleep
In my dreams, no one believes what they see

Freak
Don't wanna wait in your queue (freak)
Don't understand all your rules (freak)
Don't look like (freak)
Don't don't act like (freak freak freak freak)
Don't see the world in the way that you do

[Pre-Chorus]
How I present represents what's on the inside (just like a...)
You don't understand, though
You wade in the shallow (just like a...)
Everything's pink in my mind
So you can't see sad with your eyes

[Chorus]
I feel pink, yeah
Lalalalala, lalalala
You say that I'm blue
But I feel pink, yeah
Lalalalala, lalalala
I'm just not like you
Cuz when I sink
I feel so pink, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Just like a freak!
Just like a frea- uh oh!
Just like a freak!
Just like a frea- uh oh!

[Verse 3]
Pull apart all of my pieces
Soak ‘em in liquid adhesive
Paint it all blue when it freezes
Build a new me out of paper-mâché
Pull apart all of my pieces
Soak ‘em in liquid adhesive
Paint it all blue when it freezes
Build a new me out of paper-mâché
Oh, I'm so low, uh oh
(Oh, I'm so low, uh oh)
Pull apart all of my pieces
Soak ‘em in liquid adhesive
Paint it all blue when it freezes
Build a new me out of paper-mâché

[Outro]
Lalalalala, lalalalalala....

Just like a freak!
Just like a frea- uh oh!
Just like a freak!
Just like a frea- uh oh!
