[Intro]
She felt time move faster every day she lived
Minutes become seconds and the sands run through her fingertips

[Verse One]
She's 18 and a state
Drinks thirteen coffees a day
But they grow cold
She's lost control
As all the light fades away

Her birthdays pass in a flash
Wishing those easy days back
Imaginary friends, baked cookies, make dens
But time's in charge and everything ends

(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!)

[Chorus]
Seven seconds to breakdown
What makes you whole now?
Doubled your age, but half alive
Gum and sixpence in your purse
You're living in reverse
Oh, babe, you've wasted all your time
Why not take five? Forget your mind?
It's not like we get three lives
Too overcome with all you haven't done
Too late!
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

[Verse Two]
Last week she tried yoga
Bought a scrunchie and a mat
New things help the time move slow
The internet told her that

She'd reached a 20-and-5
Blue-beaten trainers were tied
But simply couldn't outrun the constant pacing of time
The tick-a-tok of the clock
Just take your time, babe, and stop
But taking's a task, cause how do you clasp
The passage of time when it's moving so fast?

(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!)

[Chorus]
Seven seconds to breakdown
What makes you whole now?
Doubled your age, but half alive
Gum and sixpence in your purse
You're living in reverse
Oh, babe, you've wasted all your time
Why not take five? Forget your mind?
It's not like we get three lives
Too overcome with all you haven't done
Too late!
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

[Bridge]
And now she's sat at your bed
Counting the breaths in her head
Trying hard to memorize all that you've said
At 35, the time stopped
A goodbye shared at this spot
To the one who taught her how to read the hands of a watch

[Chorus]
Seven seconds to breakdown
What makes you whole now?
Blinded by time when she's half-alive
"Call it 6," writes down the nurse
No, clocks can't be reversed
Oh, babe, you wasted all your time
Why not take five? Forget your mind?
It's not like we get three lives
Too overcome with all you haven't done

Too late!
5, 4, 3, 2, -
