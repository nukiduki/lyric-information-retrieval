[Part I: TRUE BLUE]

[Intro]
Mm, mm, mm

[Chorus]
I try to live in black and white, but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true (Blue)
And I'm still so blue, oh

[Verse]
I thought we were the same
Birds of a feather, now I'm ashamed
I told you a lie, désolée, mon amour
I'm tryin' my best, don't know what's in store
Open up the door (Blue)
In the back of my mind, I'm still overseas
A bird in a cage, thought you were made for me

[Chorus]
I try (I'm not what) to live in black and white, but I'm so blue (But I'm not what you need)
I'd like (Not what you need) to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true, true
And I'm still so bluе (And it's not true)
I'm true blue, truе blue
I'm true blue

[Outro]
(Blue) Mm, mm, mm

[Part II: BORN BLUE]

[Intro]
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah

[Verse 1]
You were born bluer than a butterfly
Beautiful and so deprived of oxygen
Colder than your father's eyes
He never learned to sympathize with anyone

[Chorus]
I don't blame you
But I can't change you
Don't hate you (Don't hate you)
But we can't save you (But we can't save you)

[Verse 2]
You were born reachin' for your mother's hands
Victim of your father's plans to rule the world
Too afraid to step outside
Paranoid and petrified of what you've heard

[Bridge]
But they could say the same 'bout me
I sleep 'bout three hours each night
Means only twenty-one a week now, now
And I could say the same 'bout you
Born blameless, grew up famous too
Just a baby born blue now, now

[Chorus]
I don't blame you
But I can't change you
Don't hate you
But we can't save you
[Bridge]
(Same 'bout me)
(I sleep 'bout three hours each night)
(Means only twenty-one a week now)
(Same 'bout me)
(I sleep 'bout three hours each night)
(Means only twenty-one a week now)
(Same 'bout me)
(I sleep 'bout three hours each night)
(Means only twenty-one a week now)
(Same 'bout me)
(I sleep 'bout three hours each night)
(Means only twenty-one a week now)
Ooh-ooh
It's over now
It's over now
It's over now
(Ah-ah-ah, ah)

[Outro]
But when can I hear the next one?
