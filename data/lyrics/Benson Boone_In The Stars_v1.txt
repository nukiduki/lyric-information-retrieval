[Verse 1]
Sunday mornings were your favorite
I used to meet you down on Woods Creek Road
You did your hair up like you were famous
Even though it's only church where we were going
Now Sunday mornings, I just sleep in
It's like I've buried my faith with you
I'm screaming at a God, I don't know if I believe in
'Cause I don't know what else I can do

[Chorus]
I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces

[Verse 2]
Digging through your old birthday letters
A crumpled twenty still in the box
I don't think that I could ever find a way to spend it
Even if it's the last twenty that I've got

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces

[Bridge]
I'm still holding (On), holding (On), holding on
I'm still holding (On), holding (On), holding on
I'm still holding (On), holding (On), I'm still holding on
I'm still, ooh, still holding on

[Chorus]
I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a billion different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces
