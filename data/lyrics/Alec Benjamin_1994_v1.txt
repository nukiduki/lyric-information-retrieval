[Verse 1]
This is where I broke my wrist, where I thought I could fly
Thinking I was Superman, so you know you can't cry
Because I wanted to be just like them and save my city from crime
I wanted to be just like them, just like them, just like them
Campbell's chicken noodle soup when you stay home from school
Remember watching MTV when there was still music for you
Just a kid on Cholla Street from my city built in the sand
My father said, "You'll be a man, be a man, be a man"

[Chorus]
I was born in 1994
I was born in 1994
And I was, I was born in 1994

[Verse 2]
I guess Santa Claus is just not real and Batman can't fly
And nobody's invincible because I know people die
I saw it on the news one day when the towers fell down
September's not the same place now, same place now, same place now
Now tell me what you wanna be because you grow up too fast
I'll cut my hair and sag my jeans and never show up to class
Get ready 'cause it's time to leave, so pack up your bags
And go be who you wanna be, wanna be, wanna be

[Chorus]
I was born in 1994
I was born in 1994
And I was, I was born in 1994

[Bridge]
My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty
My country 'tis of thee, be who you wanna be
My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty
My country, my country, my country, my

[Chorus]
I was born in 1994
I was born in 1994
And I was, I was born in 1994
