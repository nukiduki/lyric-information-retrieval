[Chorus]
Oh, I loved you, miss
And you will be grieved, I swear
But I won't be blamed
'Cause I loved you, miss

[Verse 1]
She moans and she falls and you rarely ever see
Just where she goes when she's not here standing next to me
From what I understand, it's somewhat so outlandish
That she don't wanna be seen

[Bridge]
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
Hеy, hey, hey
Hey, yеah, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, I loved you, miss
And you will be grieved, I swear
But I won't be blamed
'Cause I loved you, miss
