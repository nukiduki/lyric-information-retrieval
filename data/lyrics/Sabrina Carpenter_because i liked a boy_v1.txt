[Verse 1]
I said I wanted Thin Mints and you said you knew a guy
You showed up with a boombox and stars in your eyes
Who knew cuddling on trampolines could be so reckless?
We bonded over Black Eyed Peas and complicated exes

[Pre-Chorus]
Fell so deeply into it
It was all so innocent

[Chorus]
Now I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut
I got death threats fillin' up semitrucks
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked
I'm the hot topic on your tongue
I'm a rebound gettin' 'round stealin' from the young
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked a boy

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, mmm

[Verse 2]
I'm not catastrophizing, everything's derailing
Was only tryna hold you close while your heart was failing
It's not internet illusion, just two kids going through it
You said I'm too late to be your first love, but I'll always be your favorite

[Chorus]
Now I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut
I got death threats fillin' up semitrucks
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked
I'm the hot topic on your tongue
I'm a rebound gettin' 'round stealin' from the young
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked a boy

[Post-Chorus]
Ah
Ah
Ah
All because I liked a boy

[Bridge]
Fell so deeply into it
It was all so innocent
Dating boys with exes
No, I wouldn't recommend it

[Chorus]
I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut
I got death threats fillin' up semitrucks
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked a boy
And all of this for what?
When everything went down, we'd already broken up
Please tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked a boy

[Outro]
Ah (A boy)
Ah (A boy)
Ah
All because I liked a boy
