[Chorus]
I've been fightin' the changes
Tearin' my heart out
Wantin' to die before I open my eyes
Been fightin' the changes
Tearin' my heart out
Wantin' to die before I open my eyes

[Verse 1]
Go around the bend before the sun comes up
Things in my head just don't line up
Don't wanna leave my bed 'cause if I do, I feel like I'll die
Go around the bend before the sun comes up
Things in my head just don't line up
Don't wanna leave my bed 'cause every time I do, I feel like

[Chorus]
I've been fightin' the changes
Tearin' my heart out

Breakdown
Think I'm gonna breakdown
Think I'm gonna fade out
Think I'm gonna breakdown
Oh-oh
Breakdown
Think I'm gonna breakdown
Think I'm gonna fade out
Think I'm gonna breakdown
Oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Don't forget to put your feet in the grass
Tell your mum that you love her, say that you cleaned up your act
Give money to the homeless man, help him buy a bar
When you're buying your morning coffee, ask them how they are
God save the Sunday morning, pray for me on the Saturday night
Talk polite, don't start fights, don't tell lies
That's for the people with oblivious shortsight
One day we'll meet, man, and I'll say, "Alright"
See the world is pretty big, man, but don't feel small in it
Sometimes you lose a number, but I swear you're still callin' it
I promise you it'll be alright in the end
Fuck the depression, it's all in your head
Stay with your friends and walk up the hill at quarter to 6 in the morning
Take in the air while everyone else is still snoring
Express yourself with your friends, they'll save your life, you know
Everything's about connection, you don't have to be alone

[Chorus]
Breakdown
Think I'm gonna breakdown
Think I'm gonna fade out
Think I'm gonna breakdown
Oh-oh
Breakdown
Think I'm gonna breakdown
Think I'm gonna fade out
Think I'm gonna breakdown
Oh-oh, oh
