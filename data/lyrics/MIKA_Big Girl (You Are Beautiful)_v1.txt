[Intro]
Big girl, you are beautiful...

[Verse]
Walks into the room, feels like a big balloon
I said, "Hey girls, you are beautiful"
"Diet coke and a pizza, please." Diet coke! I'm on my knees
Screaming, "Big girl, you are beautiful!"

[Pre-Chorus]
You take your skinny girls, I feel like I'm gonna die
'Cause a real woman needs a real man, here's why:
You take your girl and multiply her by four
Now a whole lotta woman needs a whole lot more

[Chorus]
Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge, find yourself a big lady
Big boy, come on round, and they’ll be calling you "baby"
No need to fantasize since I was in my braces
Of a watering hole where the girls are round and curves in all the right places

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!

[Verse]
Walks into the room, feels like a big balloon
I said, "Hey girls, you are beautiful"
"Diet coke and a pizza, please." Diet coke! I'm on my knees
Screaming, "Big girl, you are beautiful!"

[Pre-Chorus]
You take your girl and multiply her by four
Now a whole lotta woman needs a whole lot more

[Chorus]
Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge, find yourself a big lady
Big boy, come on round, and they’ll be calling you "baby"
No need to fantasize since I was in my braces
Of a watering hole where the girls are round and curves in all the right places

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!

[Chorus]
Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge, find yourself a big lady
Big boy, come on round, and they’ll be calling you "baby"
No need to fantasize since I was in my braces
Of a watering hole where the girls are round and curves in all the right places

[Bridge]
Big girls, you are beautiful!
Big girls, you are beautiful!
Big girls, you are beautiful!
Big girls, you are beautiful! (Oh, you are beautiful!)

[Chorus]
Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge, find yourself a big lady
Big boy, come on round, and they’ll be calling you "baby"
No need to fantasize since I was in my braces
Of a watering hole where the girls are round and curves in all the right places

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!

[Chorus]
Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge, find yourself a big lady
Big boy, come on round, and they’ll be calling you "baby"
No need to fantasize since I was in my braces
Of a watering hole where the girls are round and curves in all the right places

[Outro]
Big girl, you are beautiful!
Big girl, you are beautiful!
Big girl, you are beautiful!
Big girl, you are beautiful!
Big girl, you are beautiful...
