[Verse 1]
I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
I only know I never want to let you go
'Cause you've started something, oh, can't you see?
That ever since we met you've had a hold on me

[Refrain]
It happens to be true
I only want to be with you

[Verse 2]
It doesn't matter where you go or what you do
I want to spend each moment of the day with you
Oh, look what has happened with just one kiss
I never knew that I could be in love like this

[Refrain]
It's crazy but it's true
I only want to be with you

[Pre-Chorus]
You stopped and smiled at me
And asked if I'd care to dance
I fell into your open arms
And I didn't stand a chance

[Chorus]
Now listen honey
I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together, honey, I don't care
'Cause you've started something, oh, can't you see?
That ever since we met you've had a hold on me

[Refrain]
No matter what you do
I only want to be with you

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you stopped and you smiled at me
And asked if I'd care to dance
I fell into your open arms
I didn't stand a chance

[Chorus]
Now hear me tell you
I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together, honey, I don't care
'Cause you've started something, oh, can't you see?
That ever since we met you've had a hold on me

[Refrain]
No matter what you do
I only want to be with you

[Outro]
I said, no matter, no matter what you do
I only want to be with you
