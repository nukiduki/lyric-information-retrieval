[Verse 1]
I wish I didn't feel this way
I've lived and made some bad mistakes
If I could escape the thoughts in my brain
I would travel far, so fucking far away

[Chorus 1]
Ain't it fun growing up?
Wishing you were never made
My head is fucked, don't know what
What is real and what is fake
The boy's a gun, an atom bomb
That's bound to crash and break
It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world
And I'm insane

[Verse 2]
My mom and dad both seem to say
"Oh Mad, a future gone to waste"
If I had a normal coming of age
I would be the son they dreamed of everyday

[Chorus 2]
Ain't it dumb growing up?
And the world wants you to break
God it sucks, knowing what
What is causing all my pain
I hate my guts, I'm so done
Being everyones mistake
It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world
And I'm insane

[Outro]
Some day I'll be gone without a trace
If I hate myself I'll just change in every way
Crazy, psychopathic and deranged
It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world
And I'm the king
