[Verse 1]
Bled my heart out pen to pad
I sang sad songs about my dad
And turns out no one’s into that
Except for all my superfans

[Pre-Chorus]
Team just got the numbers in said:
"Try it more like Ed Sheeran"
But he’s not me and I’m not him
And no offense he’s great and everything

[Chorus]
If I set my hair on fire
Would you notice then?
Would it make a difference?
Would you be my superfan?
If I sang the way you wanted
If I played pretend
Would you love me then?
Would you be my superfan?

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I’m your superfan
'Cause I’m your supеrfan

[Verse 2]
I grew up a lonely kid
On Elliott Smith and Radiohead
But now all my hеroes are dead
Or get the news from Joe Rogan

[Pre-Chorus]
They showed me my new business plan
It said be more like Ed Sheeran
But he’s not me and I’m not him
And no offense I love that song he sings
And that looping thing

[Chorus]
If I set my hair on fire
Would you notice then?
Would it make a difference?
Would you be my superfan?
If I sang the way you wanted
If I played pretend
Would you love me then?
Would you be my superfan?

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I’m your superfan
'Cause I’m your superfan

[Bridge]
Tried to name-check Taylor Swift
But soon as the words left my lips
The Swifties caused the earth to shift
And I got a cease and desist airdropped to me

[Post-Bridge]
I think they’re watching me
She is a God to me
She is all knowing
She is all knowing

[Chorus]
If I set my hair on fire
Would you notice then?
Would it make a difference?
Would you be my superfan?
If I sang the way you wanted
If I played pretend
Would you love me then?
Would you be my superfan?

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I’m your superfan, I'm your superfan
'Cause I’m your superfan, I'm your superfan
