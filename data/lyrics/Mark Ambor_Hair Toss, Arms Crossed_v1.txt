[Verse 1]
Said, "Hi" when I saw you
Walked by when I said it
So I sat back down and my friends told me to forget it
Now your hair's on my pillow
Cheeks red with your lipstick
But I still walk by and you don't say hit, reminiscent

[Chorus]
You do that hair toss, arms crossed, never reply
You do that turn 'round, walk out, too good for goodbyes
And I'm wishing that you'd just stay
But you're pulling out the driveway
I keep walking towards you
You keep walking away

[Post-Chorus]
Mm, mm, mm-hmm
Mm, mm, mm-hmm, mm
Mm, mm, mm-hmm
Mm, mm, mm-hmm

[Verse 2]
And my dad think it's stupid
But I kinda like it
'Cause I won't get bored and it's actually satisfying
Tell me is it normal (Mm, mm, mm-hmm)
I'm surprised when you answer? (Mm, mm, mm-hmm)
You could hang up on me a hundred times
But I'd give you a million chances

[Chorus]
You do that hair toss, arms crossed, never reply
You do that turn 'round, walk out, too good for goodbyes
And I'm wishing that you'd just stay
But you're pulling out the driveway
I keep walking towards you
You keep walking away

[Post-Chorus]
Mm, mm, mm-hmm
Mm, mm, mm-hmm, mm
Mm, mm, mm-hmm
Mm, mm, mm-hmm

[Bridge]
So I hope that you keep making me chase you now
'Causе the way that you leave
Makеs me love it when you come around
So I hope that you keep making me chase you now
'Cause the way that you leave
Makes me love it when you come around

[Outro]
You do that hair toss, arms crossed
You do that turn 'round, walk out
